AC-2:supplement:<del>Information s</del><ins>S</ins>ystem account types include, for example, individual, shared, group, system, guest<del>/</del><ins>, </ins>anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and service. <del>Some of the account management requirements listed above can be implemented by organizational information systems. </del>The identification of authorized users of the <del>information </del>system and the specification of access privileges reflects the requirements in other <del>se</del>c<del>urity c</del>ontrols in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on <del>information </del>system accounts receive additional scrutiny by appropriate organizational personnel <del>(</del><ins>r</ins>e<del>.</del><ins>sponsible for approvin</ins>g<del>.</del><ins> such accounts and privileged access</ins>, <ins>including, for example, </ins>system owner, mission/business owner, or chief information security officer<del>) responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access</del>. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements <del>(e.g., scheduled m</del>a<del>i</del>n<del>tenance, system upgra</del>d<del>es)</del> <del>and </del>mission/business requirements<del>, (e</del>.<del>g.,</del> <del>time zone differences, customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). </del>Failure to consider these factors could affect <del>information </del>system availability. Temporary and emergency accounts are <del>accounts </del>intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts <del>(e.</del><ins>includin</ins>g<del>.</del>, <ins>for examp</ins>l<ins>e, l</ins>ocal logon accounts used for special tasks <del>defined by </del>or<del>ganizations</del> <del>or </del>when network resources are unavailable<del>)</del>. Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include, for example<del>:</del><ins>,</ins> <del>(i) </del>when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required; or <del>(ii) </del>when individuals are transferred or terminated.

AC-3 (13):supplement:<ins>Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is an access control policy that restricts system access to authorized users based on their organizational attributes, such as job function; environmental attributes, such as time of day; and resource attributes, such as the classification of a document. Organizations can create specific rules based on attributes and the authorizations (i.e., privileges) to perform needed operations on the systems associated with the organization-defined attributes and rules. When users are assigned to attributes defined in ABAC policies or rules, they can be provisioned to a system with appropriate privileges or dynamically granted access to a protected resource upon access.

AC-4:text:<del>The i</del><ins>E</ins>nfor<del>mation system enfor</del>ce<del>s</del> approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between interconnected systems based on [Assignment: organization-defined information flow control policies].
AC-4:supplement:Information flow control regulates where information <del>is </del><ins>c</ins>a<del>llowed</del><ins>n</ins> t<del>o t</del>ravel within a<del>n</del> <del>information </del>system and between <del>information </del>systems (as opposed to who is allowed to access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include, for example, keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, restricting web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring information between <del>information </del>systems <del>represent</del>in<del>g</del> different security domains with different security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information owners<del>/</del><ins> or </ins>stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes, for example<del>:</del><ins>,</ins> <del>(i) </del>prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing access only); <del>(ii) </del>employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows; and <del>(</del>i<del>ii) i</del>mplementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security labels. Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations <del>(e.g., net</del>w<del>orks, </del>i<del>ndividuals, and devices) wi</del>thin <del>information </del>systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices <del>(e.g., ga</del>t<del>eways, routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) t</del>hat employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict <del>information </del>system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering capability based on message content<del> (e</del>.<del>g.,</del> <del>implementing key word searches or using document characteristics). </del>Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering/inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 22 primarily address cross-domain solution needs which focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, for example, high-assurance guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf information technology products.

AC-16:supplement:Information is represented internally within <del>information </del>systems using abstractions known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are typically associated with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are typically associated with data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and communications ports. Security attributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions representing the basic properties or characteristics of active and passive entities with respect to safeguarding information. <del>T</del><ins>Privacy attributes, w</ins>h<ins>ich may b</ins>e<ins> u</ins>se<ins>d</ins> <ins>independently, or in conjunction with security </ins>attributes<ins>,</ins> <ins>represent the basic properties or characteristics of an entity with respect to the </ins>ma<ins>nagement of personall</ins>y <ins>identifia</ins>b<ins>l</ins>e <ins>inform</ins>a<ins>tion.

AP-1:supplement:<del>Before collecting PII, the organization determines whether the contemplated collection of PII is legally authorized. Program officials consult with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) and legal counsel regarding the authority of any program or activity to collect PII. The authority to collect PII is documented in the System of Records Notice (SORN) and/or Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) or other applicable documentation such as Privacy Act Statements or Computer Matching Agreements.

AP-2:text:<del>The organization describes the purpose(s) for which personally identifiable information (PII) is collected, used, maintained, and shared in its privacy notices.</del>
AP-2:supplement:<del>Often, statutory language expressly authorizes specific collections and uses of PII. When statutory language is written broadly and thus subject to interpretation, organizations ensure, in consultation with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) and legal counsel, that there is a close nexus between the general authorization and any specific collection of PII. Once the specific purposes have been identified, the purposes are clearly described in the related privacy compliance documentation, including but not limited to Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs), System of Records Notices (SORNs), and Privacy Act Statements provided at the time of collection (e.g., on forms organizations use to collect PII). Further, in order to avoid unauthorized collections or uses of PII, personnel who handle PII receive training on the organizational authorities for collecting PII, authorized uses of PII, and on the contents of the notice.

AR-1:supplement:<del>The development and implementation of a comprehensive governance and privacy program demonstrates organizational accountability for and commitment to the protection of individual privacy. Accountability begins with the appointment of an SAOP/CPO with the authority, mission, resources, and responsibility to develop and implement a multifaceted privacy program. The SAOP/CPO, in consultation with legal counsel, information security officials, and others as appropriate: (i) ensures the development, implementation, and enforcement of privacy policies and procedures; (ii) defines roles and responsibilities for protecting PII; (iii) determines the level of information sensitivity with regard to PII holdings; (iv) identifies the laws, regulations, and internal policies that apply to the PII; (v) monitors privacy best practices; and (vi) monitors/audits compliance with identified privacy controls. To further accountability, the SAOP/CPO develops privacy plans to document the privacy requirements of organizations and the privacy and security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements. The plan serves as evidence of organizational privacy operations and supports resource requests by the SAOP/CPO. A single plan or multiple plans may be necessary depending upon the organizational structures, requirements, and resources, and the plan(s) may vary in comprehensiveness. For example, a one-page privacy plan may cover privacy policies, documentation, and controls already in place, such as Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA) and System of Records Notices (SORN). A comprehensive plan may include a baseline of privacy controls selected from this appendix and include: (i) processes for conducting privacy risk assessments; (ii) templates and guidance for completing PIAs and SORNs; (iii) privacy training and awareness requirements; (iv) requirements for contractors processing PII; (v) plans for eliminating unnecessary PII holdings; and (vi) a framework for measuring annual performance goals and objectives for implementing identified privacy controls.</del>

AR-2:supplement:<del>Organizational privacy risk management processes operate across the life cycles of all mission/business processes that collect, use, maintain, share, or dispose of PII. The tools and processes for managing risk are specific to organizational missions and resources. They include, but are not limited to, the conduct of PIAs. The PIA is both a process and the document that is the outcome of that process. OMB Memorandum 03-22 provides guidance to organizations for implementing the privacy provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002, including guidance on when PIAs are required for information systems. Some organizations may be required by law or policy to extend the PIA requirement to other activities involving PII or otherwise impacting privacy (e.g., programs, projects, or regulations). PIAs are conducted to identify privacy risks and identify methods to mitigate those risks. PIAs are also conducted to ensure that programs or information systems comply with legal, regulatory, and policy requirements. PIAs also serve as notice to the public of privacy practices. PIAs are performed before developing or procuring information systems, or initiating programs or projects, that collect, use, maintain, or share PII and are updated when changes create new privacy risks.</del>

AR-4:title:<del>PRIVACY MONITORING AND AUDITING</del>
AR-4:text:<del>The organization monitors and audits privacy controls and internal privacy policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to ensure effective implementation.</del>
AR-4:supplement:<del>To promote accountability, organizations identify and address gaps in privacy compliance, management, operational, and technical controls by conducting regular assessments (e.g., internal risk assessments). These assessments can be self-assessments or third-party audits that result in reports on compliance gaps identified in programs, projects, and information systems. In addition to auditing for effective implementation of all privacy controls identified in this appendix, organizations assess whether they: (i) implement a process to embed privacy considerations into the life cycle of personally identifiable information (PII), programs, information systems, mission/business processes, and technology; (ii) monitor for changes to applicable privacy laws, regulations, and policies; (iii) track programs, information systems, and applications that collect and maintain PII to ensure compliance; (iv) ensure that access to PII is only on a need-to-know basis; and (v) ensure that PII is being maintained and used only for the legally authorized purposes identified in the public notice(s). Organizations also: (i) implement technology to audit for the security, appropriate use, and loss of PII; (ii) perform reviews to ensure physical security of documents containing PII; (iii) assess contractor compliance with privacy requirements; and (iv) ensure that corrective actions identified as part of the assessment process are tracked and monitored until audit findings are corrected. The organization Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) coordinates monitoring and auditing efforts with information security officials and ensures that the results are provided to senior managers and oversight officials.

AR-5:supplement:<del>Through implementation of a privacy training and awareness strategy, the organization promotes a culture of privacy. Privacy training and awareness programs typically focus on broad topics, such as responsibilities under the Privacy Act of 1974 and E-Government Act of 2002 and the consequences of failing to carry out those responsibilities, how to identify new privacy risks, how to mitigate privacy risks, and how and when to report privacy incidents. Privacy training may also target data collection and use requirements identified in public notices, such as Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) or System of Records Notices (SORNs) for a program or information system. Specific training methods may include: (i) mandatory annual privacy awareness training; (ii) targeted, role-based training; (iii) internal privacy program websites; (iv) manuals, guides, and handbooks; (v) slide presentations; (vi) events (e.g., privacy awareness week, privacy clean-up day); (vii) posters and brochures; and (viii) email messages to all employees and contractors. Organizations update training based on changing statutory, regulatory, mission, program, business process, and information system requirements, or on the results of compliance monitoring and auditing. Where appropriate, organizations may provide privacy training as part of existing information security training. Related controls: AR-3, AT-2, AT-3, TR-1.</del>

AR-7:text:<del>The organization designs information systems to support privacy by automating privacy controls.</del>
AR-7:supplement:<del>To the extent feasible, when designing organizational information systems, organizations employ technologies and system capabilities that automate privacy controls on the collection, use, retention, and disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII). By building privacy controls into system design and development, organizations mitigate privacy risks to PII, thereby reducing the likelihood of information system breaches and other privacy-related incidents. Organizations also conduct periodic reviews of systems to determine the need for updates to maintain compliance with the Privacy Act and the organization's privacy policy. Regardless of whether automated privacy controls are employed, organizations regularly monitor information system use and sharing of PII to ensure that the use/sharing is consistent with the authorized purposes identified in the Privacy Act and/or in the public notice of organizations, or in a manner compatible with those purposes.

AU-2:supplement:An event is any observable occurrence in an organizational <del>information </del>system. Organizations identify audit event<ins> type</ins>s as those events which are significant and relevant to the security of <del>information </del>systems and the environments in which those systems operate <del>in order </del>to meet specific and ongoing audit needs. Audit event<ins> type</ins>s can include, for example, password changes<del>,</del><ins>;</ins> failed logons<del>,</del> or failed accesses related to <del>information </del>systems<ins>; security attribute changes</ins>, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, <del>o</del><ins>que</ins>r<ins>y</ins> <del>third-</del>par<ins>ame</ins>t<del>y</del><ins>ers,</ins> <ins>or external </ins>credential usage. In determining the set of auditable event<ins> type</ins>s, organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of the security controls to be implemented. To balance auditing requirements with other <del>information </del>system needs, this control also requires identifying that subset of auditable event<ins> type</ins>s that are audited at a given point in time. For example, organizations may determine that <del>information </del>systems must have the capability to log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. Auditing requirements, including the need for auditable events, may be referenced in other security <ins>and priva</ins>c<ins>y c</ins>ontrols and control enhancements<ins> for example, AC-2(4), AC-3(10), AC-6(9), AC-16(11), AC-17(1), CM-3</ins>.<ins>f,</ins> <ins>CM-5(1), IA-3(3.b), MA-4(1), MP-4(2), PA-4.d, PE-3, PM-22, RA-8, SC-7(9), SC-7(15), SI-3(8), SI-4(22), SI-7(8), and SI-10(1). </ins>Organizations also include auditable event<ins> type</ins>s that are required by applicable <del>federa</del>l<del> l</del>aws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, <del>and </del>standards<ins>, and guidelines</ins>. Audit records can be generated at various levels<del> of abstraction</del>, including at the packet level as information traverses the network.

AU-16:supplement:When organizations use <del>information </del>systems and/or services of external organizations, the auditing capability necessitates a coordinated approach across organizations. For example, maintaining the identity of individuals that requested <ins>s</ins>p<del>art</del><ins>ec</ins>i<ins>fi</ins>c<del>ular</del> services across organizational boundaries may often be very difficult, and doing so may prove to have significant performance <ins>and p</ins>r<ins>iv</ins>a<ins>cy ra</ins>mifications. Therefore, it is often the case that cross-organizational auditing <del>(e.g., the type of auditing capability provided by </del>s<del>erv</del>i<del>ce-oriented architectures) si</del>mply captures the identity of individuals issuing requests at the initial <del>information </del>system, and subsequent systems record that the requests emanated from authorized individuals.

AU-16 (2):supplement:Because of the distributed nature of the audit information, cross-organization sharing of audit information may be essential for effective analysis of the auditing being performed. For example, the audit records of one organization may not provide sufficient information to determine the appropriate or inappropriate use of organizational information resources by individuals in other organizations. In some instances, only the home organizations of individuals have the appropriate knowledge to make such determinations, thus requiring the sharing of audit information among organizations.<ins> Related Controls: IR-4, SI-4.</ins>

CA-2 (1):supplement:Independent assessors or assessment teams are individuals or groups <del>who </del>conduct<ins>ing</ins> impartial assessments of <del>organizational information </del>systems. Impartiality implies that assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest <del>with </del>regard<ins>ing</ins> <del>to the </del>development, operation, <ins>sustainment, </ins>or management of the <del>organizational information </del>systems under assessment or t<del>o t</del>he determination of <del>se</del>c<del>urity c</del>ontrol effectiveness. To achieve impartiality, assessors should not<del>:</del> <del>(i) </del>create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted; <del>(ii) </del>assess their own work; <del>(iii) </del>act as management or employees of the organizations they are serving; or <del>(iv) </del>place themselves in positions of advocacy for the organizations acquiring their services. Independent assessments can be obtained from elements within organizations or can be contracted to public or private sector entities outside of organizations. Authorizing officials determine the required level of independence based on the security categories of <del>information </del>systems and/or the <del>ultimate </del>risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. Authorizing officials also determine if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient assurance that the results are sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based decisions. This includes determining whether contracted <del>security </del>assessment services have sufficient independence, for example, when <del>information </del>system owners are not directly involved in contracting processes or cannot <del>unduly </del>influence the impartiality of assessors conducting assessments. <del>In special situations, for example, w</del><ins>W</ins>hen organizations that own the <del>information </del>systems are small or organizational structures require that assessments are conducted by individuals that are in the developmental, operational, or management chain of system owners, independence in assessment processes can be achieved by ensuring that assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by independent teams of experts to validate the completeness, accuracy, integrity, and reliability of the results. Organizations recognize that assessments performed for purposes other than direct support to authorization decisions are, when performed by assessors with sufficient independence, more likely to be useable for such decisions, thereby reducing the need to repeat assessments<ins>.

CM-2 (6):supplement:Establishing separate baseline configurations for development, testing, and operational environments helps protect <del>information </del>systems from unplanned/unexpected events related to development and testing activities. Separate baseline configurations allow organizations to apply the configuration management that is most appropriate for each type of configuration. For example, management of operational configurations typically emphasizes the need for stability, while management of development/test configurations requires greater flexibility. Configurations in the test environment mirror the configurations in the operational environment to the extent practicable so that the results of the testing are representative of the proposed changes to the operational systems.

Organizations establish organization-wide configuration settings and subsequently derive specific <ins>configuration </ins>settings for <del>information </del>systems. The established settings become part of the systems configuration baseline. Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown and hardening guides, security reference guides, security technical implementation guides) provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for specific information technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring those <del>information </del>system components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety of organizations including, for example, information technology product developers, manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and other organizations in the public and private sectors. <ins>Implementation of a specific common secure configuration may be mandated at the organizational or mission/business process level or may be mandated at a higher level including, for example, by a regulatory agency. </ins>Common secure configurations include the United States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB) which affects the implementation of CM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7.

CP-2:supplement:Contingency planning for <del>information </del>systems is part of an overall organizational program for achieving continuity of operations for mission/business functions. Contingency planning addresses <del>both information </del>system restoration and implementation of alternative mission<del>/</del><ins> or </ins>business processes when systems are compromised<ins> or breached</ins>. The effectiveness of contingency planning is maximized by considering such planning throughout the <del>pha</del>s<del>es of the s</del>ystem development life cycle. Performing contingency planning on hardware, software, and firmware development can be an effective means of achieving <del>information </del>system resiliency. Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational <del>information </del>systems since not all systems <del>may </del>need to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired. <del>Information s</del><ins>S</ins>ystem recovery objectives reflect applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, regulations, and guidelines. In addition to <del>inform</del>a<del>tion system a</del>vailability, contingency plans a<del>lso a</del>ddress other security-related events resulting in a reduction in mission <del>and/</del>or business effectiveness, such as malicious attacks compromising the confidentiality or integrity of <del>information </del>systems. Actions addressed in contingency plans include, for example, orderly<del>/</del><ins> and </ins>graceful degradation, <del>information </del>system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for when systems are under attack. By c<del>l</del>o<del>sely c</del>o<del>o</del>rdinating contingency planning with incident handling activities, organizations can ensure that the necessary <del>contingency </del>planning activities are in place and activated in the event of a security incident.

DI-1:supplement:<del>Organizations take reasonable steps to confirm the accuracy and relevance of PII. Such steps may include, for example, editing and validating addresses as they are collected or entered into information systems using automated address verification look-up application programming interfaces (API). The types of measures taken to protect data quality are based on the nature and context of the PII, how it is to be used, and how it was obtained. Measures taken to validate the accuracy of PII that is used to make determinations about the rights, benefits, or privileges of individuals under federal programs may be more comprehensive than those used to validate less sensitive PII. Additional steps may be necessary to validate PII that is obtained from sources other than individuals or the authorized representatives of individuals. When PII is of a sufficiently sensitive nature (e.g., when it is used for annual reconfirmation of a taxpayer's income for a recurring benefit), organizations incorporate mechanisms into information systems and develop corresponding procedures for how frequently, and by what method, the information is to be updated.

DM-1:supplement:<del>Organizations take appropriate steps to ensure that the collection of PII is consistent with a purpose authorized by law or regulation. The minimum set of PII elements required to support a specific organization business process may be a subset of the PII the organization is authorized to collect. Program officials consult with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) and legal counsel to identify the minimum PII elements required by the information system or activity to accomplish the legally authorized purpose. Organizations can further reduce their privacy and security risks by also reducing their inventory of PII, where appropriate. OMB Memorandum 07-16 requires organizations to conduct both an initial review and subsequent reviews of their holdings of all PII and ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that such holdings are accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. Organizations are also directed by OMB to reduce their holdings to the minimum necessary for the proper performance of a documented organizational business purpose. OMB Memorandum 07-16 requires organizations to develop and publicize, either through a notice in the Federal Register or on their websites, a schedule for periodic reviews of their holdings to supplement the initial review. Organizations coordinate with their federal records officers to ensure that reductions in organizational holdings of PII are consistent with NARA retention schedules. By performing periodic evaluations, organizations reduce risk, ensure that they are collecting only the data specified in the notice, and ensure that the data collected is still relevant and necessary for the purpose(s) specified in the notice.

DM-2:supplement:<del>NARA provides retention schedules that govern the disposition of federal records. Program officials coordinate with records officers and with NARA to identify appropriate retention periods and disposal methods. NARA may require organizations to retain PII longer than is operationally needed. In those situations, organizations describe such requirements in the notice. Methods of storage include, for example, electronic, optical media, or paper. Examples of ways organizations may reduce holdings include reducing the types of PII held (e.g., delete Social Security numbers if their use is no longer needed) or shortening the retention period for PII that is maintained if it is no longer necessary to keep PII for long periods of time (this effort is undertaken in consultation with an organization's records officer to receive NARA approval). In both examples, organizations provide notice (e.g., an updated System of Records Notice) to inform the public of any changes in holdings of PII. Certain read-only archiving techniques, such as DVDs, CDs, microfilm, or microfiche, may not permit the removal of individual records without the destruction of the entire database contained on such media.

IA-2 (13):text:<del>The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined out-of-band authentication] under [Assignment: organization-defined conditions].</del>
IA-2 (13):supplement:<del>Out-of-band authentication (OOBA) refers to the use of two separate communication paths to identify and authenticate users or devices to an information system. The first path (i.e., the in-band path), is used to identify and authenticate users or devices, and generally is the path through which information flows. The second path (i.e., the out-of-band path) is used to independently verify the authentication and/or requested action. For example, a user authenticates via a notebook computer to a remote server to which the user desires access, and requests some action of the server via that communication path. Subsequently, the server contacts the user via the user's cell phone to verify that the requested action originated from the user. The user may either confirm the intended action to an individual on the telephone or provide an authentication code via the telephone. This type of authentication can be employed by organizations to mitigate actual or suspected man-in the-middle attacks. The conditions for activation can include, for example, suspicious activities, new threat indicators or elevated threat levels, or the impact level or classification level of information in requested transactions.

IA-5 (10):supplement:Authentication requires some form of binding between an identity and the authenticator used to confirm the identity. In conventional approaches, this binding is established by pre-provisioning both the identity and the authenticator to the <del>information </del>system. For example, the binding between a username (i.e., identity) and a password (i.e., authenticator) is accomplished by provisioning the identity and authenticator as a pair in the <del>information </del>system. New authentication techniques allow the binding between the identity and the authenticator to be implemented outside a<del>n</del> <del>information </del>system. For example, with smartcard credentials, the identity and the authenticator are bound together on the <ins>smart</ins>card. Using these credentials, <del>information </del>systems can authenticate identities that have not been pre-provisioned, dynamically provisioning the identity after authentication. In these situations, organizations can anticipate the dynamic provisioning of identities.

IA-12:supplement:<ins>Identity proofing is the process of collecting, validating, and verifying user’s identity information for the purposes of issuing credentials for accessing a system. This control is intended to mitigate threats to the registration of users and the establishment of their accounts. Standards and guidelines specifying identity assurance levels for identity proofing include NIST Special Publications 800-63 and 800-63A. Related Controls: IA-1, IA-2, IA-3, IA-4, IA-5, IA-6, IA-8. (1) IDENTITY PROOFING | SUPERVISOR AUTHORIZATION Require that the registration process to receive an account for logical access includes supervisor or sponsor authorization. Supplemental Guidance: None. Related Controls: None. (2) IDENTITY PROOFING | IDENTITY EVIDENCE Require evidence of individual identification be presented to the registration authority. Supplemental Guidance: Requiring identity evidence, such as documentary evidence or a combination of documents and biometrics, reduces the likelihood of individuals using fraudulent identification to establish an identity, or at least increases the work factor of potential adversaries. Acceptable forms of evidence are consistent with the risk to the systems, roles, and privileges associated with the user’s account. Related Controls: None. (3) IDENTITY PROOFING | IDENTITY EVIDENCE VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION Require that the presented identity evidence be validated and verified through [Assignment: organizational defined methods of validation and verification]. Supplemental Guidance: Validating and verifying identity evidence increases the assurance that that accounts, identifiers, and authenticators are being issued to the correct user. Validation refers to the process of confirming that the evidence is genuine and authentic and that the data contained in the evidence is correct, current, and related to an actual person or individual. Verification confirms and establishes a linkage between the claimed identity and the actual existence of the user presenting the evidence. Acceptable methods for validating and verifying identity evidence are consistent with the risk to the systems, roles, and privileges associated with the users account Related Controls: None. (4) IDENTITY PROOFING | IN-PERSON VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION Require that the validation and verification of identity evidence be conducted in person before a designated registration authority. Supplemental Guidance: In-person proofing reduces the likelihood of fraudulent credentials being issued because it requires the physical presence of individuals, the presentation of physical identity documents, and actual face-to-face interactions with designated registration authorities. Related Controls: None. (5) IDENTITY PROOFING | ADDRESS CONFIRMATION Require that a [Selection: registration code; notice of proofing] be delivered through an out-of-band channel to verify the users address (physical or digital) of record. Supplemental Guidance: To make it more difficult for adversaries to pose as legitimate users during the identity proofing process, organizations can use out-of-band methods to increase assurance that the individual associated with an address of record was the same person that participated in the registration. Confirmation can take the form of a temporary enrollment code or a notice of proofing. The delivery address for these artifacts are obtained from records and not self-asserted by the user. The address can include a physical or a digital address. A home address is an example of a physical address. Email addresses and telephone numbers are examples of digital addresses. Related Controls: IA-12. (6) IDENTITY PROOFING | ACCEPT EXTERNALLY-PROOFED IDENTITIES Accept externally-proofed identities at [Assignment: organization-defined identity assurance level]. Supplemental Guidance: To limit unnecessary re-proofing of identities, particularly of non-PIV users, organizations accept proofing conducted at a commensurate level of assurance by other agencies or organizations. Proofing is consistent with organizational security policy and with the identity assurance level appropriate for the system, application, or information accessed. This is a core component of managing federated identities across agencies and organizations. Related Controls: IA-3, IA-4, IA-5, IA-8.</ins>

MA-6 (2):supplement:Predictive maintenance, or condition-based maintenance, attempts to evaluate the condition of equipment by performing periodic or continuous (online) equipment condition monitoring. The goal of predictive maintenance is to perform maintenance at a scheduled point in time when the maintenance activity is most cost-effective and before the equipment loses performance within a threshold. The predictive component of predictive maintenance stems from the goal of predicting the future trend of the equipment's condition. This approach uses principles of statistical process control to determine at what point in the future maintenance activities will be appropriate. Most predictive maintenance inspections are performed while equipment is in service, thereby minimizing disruption of normal system operations. Predictive maintenance can result in substantial cost savings and higher system reliability. Predictive maintenance tends to include measurement of the item. To evaluate equipment condition, predictive maintenance utilizes nondestructive testing technologies such as infrared, acoustic (partial discharge and airborne ultrasonic), corona detection, vibration analysis, sound level measurements, oil analysis, and other specific online tests.<ins> Related Controls: None.</ins>

MP-6:supplement:This control applies to all <del>information </del>system media, both digital and non-digital, subject to disposal or reuse, whether or not the media is considered removable. Examples include<ins>:</ins> <ins>digital </ins>media found in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, network components, <del>and </del>mobile devices<ins>; and non-digital media such as paper and microfilm</ins>. The sanitization process removes information from the media such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques, including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, and destruction, prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or released for disposal. Organizations determine the appropriate sanitization methods recognizing that destruction is sometimes necessary when other methods cannot be applied to media requiring sanitization. Organizations use discretion on the employment of approved sanitization techniques and procedures for media containing information deemed to be in the public domain or publicly releasable, or deemed to have no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released for reuse or disposal. Sanitization of non-digital media includes, for example, <ins>dest</ins>r<ins>uction, r</ins>emoving a classified appendix from an otherwise unclassified document, or redacting selected sections or words from a document by obscuring the redacted sections<del>/</del><ins> or </ins>words in a manner equivalent in effectiveness to removing them from the document.

PA-1:supplement:<ins>This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of the controls and control enhancements in the PA family. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and procedures. Comprehensive policy and procedures help provide security and privacy assurance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. The procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. It is important to recognize that restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure. Related Controls: PA-2, PM-9, PS-8, SI-12.</ins>

PA-3:supplement:<ins>Statutory language often expressly authorizes specific collections and uses of personally identifiable information. When statutory language is written broadly and thus subject to interpretation, organizations consult with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy and legal counsel to verify that there is a close nexus between the general authorization and any specific collection of personally identifiable information. Once the specific purpose has been identified, the purpose is clearly described in the related privacy compliance documentation, including, for example, Privacy Impact Assessments, System of Records Notices, and Privacy Act Statements provided at the time of collection including, for example, on forms organizations use to collect personally identifiable information. Further, in order to avoid unauthorized collections or uses of personally identifiable information, personnel who manage such information receive role-based training as specified in AT-3.

These steps include, for example, monitoring and auditing organizational use of personally identifiable information and training organizational personnel on the authorized uses of such information. With guidance from the Senior Agency Official for Privacy and where appropriate, legal counsel, organizations document the processes and procedures for evaluating the proposed new uses of personally identifiable information to assess whether such uses fall within the scope of the organizational authorities. Where appropriate, organizations obtain consent from individuals for the new uses of personally identifiable information. Related Controls: None.</ins>

PL-10:text:<ins>Select a control baseline for the system.</ins>
PL-10:supplement:<ins>The selection of an appropriate control baseline is determined by the needs of organizational stakeholders. Stakeholder needs and concerns consider mission and business requirements and mandates imposed by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. For example, the three control baselines in Appendix D are based on the requirements from the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) and the Privacy Act. These requirements, along with the NIST standards and guidelines implementing the legislation, require organizations to select one of the control baselines after the reviewing the information types and the information that is processed, stored, and transmitted on organizational systems; analyzing the potential adverse impact or consequences of the loss or compromise of the system or information on the organization’s operations and assets, individuals, other organizations or the Nation; and considering the results from organizational and system assessments of risk. Nonfederal organizations that are part of other communities of interest including the U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, can develop similar control baselines (using the controls in Chapter Three) that represent the needs and concerns of those entities.

PL-11:title:<ins>BASELINE TAILORING</ins>
PL-11:text:<ins>Tailor the selected control baseline by applying specified tailoring actions.</ins>
PL-11:supplement:<ins>The concept of tailoring allows organizations to specialize or customize a set of baseline controls by applying a defined set of tailoring actions. These actions facilitate such specialization and customization by allowing organizations to develop security and privacy plans that reflect their specific missions and business functions, the environments where their systems operate, the threats and vulnerabilities that can affect their systems, and any other conditions or situations that can impact their mission or business success. The tailoring actions are described in Appendix G. Tailoring a control baseline is accomplished by identifying and designating common controls; applying scoping considerations; selecting compensating controls; assigning values to control parameters; supplementing the control baseline with additional controls, as needed; and providing information for control implementation. The general tailoring actions in Appendix G can be supplemented with additional actions based on the needs of organizations. Tailoring actions can be applied to the baselines in Appendix D in accordance with the security requirements from the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) and the privacy requirements from the Privacy Act. Alternatively, other communities of interest adopting different control baselines can apply the tailoring actions in Appendix G to specialize or customize the controls that represent the specific needs and concerns of those entities.

PM-1:supplement:Information security program plans can be represented in single documents or compilations of documents at the discretion of organizations. The plans document the program management controls and organization-defined common controls. Information security program plans provide sufficient information about the program management controls/common controls (including specification of parameters for any assignment and selection statements either explicitly or by reference) to enable implementations that are unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and a determination of the risk to be incurred if the plans are implemented as intended. <del>Th</del><ins>S</ins>e<del> se</del>curity plans for individual <del>information </del>systems and the organization-wide information security program plan<del> together</del>, provide complete coverage for all security controls employed within the organization.

PM-12:text:<del>The organization i</del><ins>I</ins>mplement<del>s</del> an insider threat program that includes a cross-discipline insider threat incident handling team.
PM-12:supplement:Organizations handling classified information are required, under Executive Order 13587 and the National Policy on Insider Threat, to establish insider threat programs. The standards and guidelines that apply to insider threat programs in classified environments can also be employed effectively to improve the security of Controlled Unclassified Information in non-national security systems. Insider threat programs include <del>se</del>c<del>urity c</del>ontrols to detect and prevent malicious insider activity through the centralized integration and analysis of both technical and non-technical information to identify potential insider threat concerns. A senior o<del>rganizational o</del>fficial is designated by the department<del>/</del><ins> or </ins>agency head as the responsible individual to implement and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized integration and analysis capability, insider threat programs as a minimum, prepare department<del>/</del><ins> or </ins>agency insider threat policies and implementation plans<del>,</del><ins>;</ins> conduct host-based user monitoring of individual employee activities on government-owned classified computers<del>,</del><ins>;</ins> provide insider threat awareness training to employees<del>,</del><ins>;</ins> receive access to information from all offices within the department<del>/agency</del> <del>(e.g., human res</del>o<del>u</del>r<del>ces,</del> <del>leg</del>a<del>l, physical s</del><ins>g</ins>e<del>curity, perso</del>n<del>nel se</del>c<del>urit</del>y<del>,</del> <del>in</del>for<del>mation</del> <del>technology, </del>in<del>formation </del>s<del>ystem secur</del>i<del>ty, an</del>d<del> law </del>e<del>nfo</del>r<del>cement)</del> <del>for insider </del>threat analysis<del>,</del><ins>;</ins> and conduct self-assessments of department<del>/</del><ins> or </ins>agency insider threat posture.

Privacy program plans can be integrated with information security plans or can be represented independently, either in a single document or in compilations of documents at the discretion of organizations. The plans document the program management controls and organization-defined common controls. Privacy program plans provide sufficient information about the program management and common controls (including specification of parameters and assignment and selection statements either explicitly or by reference) to enable control implementations that are unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and a determination of the risk incurred if the plans are implemented as intended. The privacy plans for individual systems and the organization-wide privacy program plan together provide complete coverage for all privacy controls employed within the organization. Common controls are documented in an appendix to the organization’s privacy program plan unless the controls are included in a separate privacy plan for a system. The organization-wide privacy program plan indicates which separate privacy plans contain descriptions of privacy controls. Organizations have the flexibility to describe common controls in a single document or in multiple documents. In the case of multiple documents, the documents describing common controls are included as attachments to the privacy program plan. If the privacy program plan contains multiple documents, the organization specifies in each document, the organizational official or officials responsible for the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring of the respective common controls.

RA-2 (1):text:<ins>Conduct a second-level categorization of organizational systems to obtain additional granularity on system impact levels.</ins>
RA-2 (1):supplement:<ins>Organizations apply the “high water mark” concept to each of their systems categorized in accordance with FIPS Publication 199. This process results in systems designated as low impact, moderate impact, or high impact. Organizations desiring additional granularity in the system impact designations for risk-based decision making, can further partition the systems into sub-categories of the initial, first-level system categorization. For example, a second-level categorization on a moderate-impact system can produce three new sub-categories: low-moderate systems, moderate-moderate systems, and high-moderate systems. This secondary categorization and the resulting sub-categories of the system give organizations an opportunity to further prioritize their investments related to security control selection and the tailoring of control baselines in responding to identified risks. Second-level categorization can also be used to determine those systems that are exceptionally critical to organizational missions and business operations. These systems are sometimes described as high-value assets and thus, organizations may be more focused on complexity, aggregation, and interconnections. Such systems can be identified by partitioning high-impact systems into low-high systems, moderate-high systems, and high-high systems. Related Controls: None.</ins>

RA-7:supplement:<ins>Organizations have a variety of options for responding to risk including: mitigating the risk by implementing new controls or strengthening existing controls; accepting the risk with appropriate justification or rationale; sharing or transferring the risk; or rejecting the risk. Organizational risk tolerance influences risk response decisions and actions. Risk response is also known as risk treatment. This control addresses the need to determine an appropriate response to risk before a plan of action and milestones entry is generated. For example, the response may be to accept risk or reject risk, or it may be possible to mitigate the risk immediately so a plan of action and milestones entry is not needed. However, if the risk response is to mitigate the risk and the mitigation cannot be completed immediately, a plan of action and milestones entry is generated.

RA-8:supplement:<ins>Privacy impact assessments are an analysis of how information is managed to ensure that such management conforms to applicable legal, regulatory, and policy requirements regarding privacy; to determine the associated privacy risks and effects of creating, collecting, using, processing, storing, maintaining, disseminating, disclosing, and disposing of information in identifiable form in a system; and to examine and evaluate the protections and alternate processes for managing information to mitigate potential privacy concerns. A privacy impact assessment is an analysis and a formal document detailing the process and outcome of the analysis. To conduct the analysis, organizations use risk assessment processes. Although privacy impact assessments may be required by law, organizations may develop policies to require privacy impact assessments in circumstances where a privacy impact assessment would not be required by law.

RA-9:title:<ins>CRITICALITY ANALYSIS</ins>
RA-9:text:<ins>Identify critical system components and functions by performing a criticality analysis for [Assignment: organization-defined systems, system components, or system services] at [Assignment: organization-defined decision points in the system development life cycle].</ins>
RA-9:supplement:<ins>Not all system components, functions, or services necessarily require significant protections. Criticality analysis is a key tenet of, for example, supply chain risk management, and informs the prioritization of protection activities. The identification of critical system components and functions considers applicable regulations, directives, policies, standards, and guidelines, system functionality requirements, system and component interfaces, and system and component dependencies. Systems engineers conduct an end-to-end functional decomposition of a system to identify mission-critical functions and components. The functional decomposition includes the identification of core organizational missions supported by the system, decomposition into the specific functions to perform those missions, and traceability to the hardware, software, and firmware components that implement those functions, including when the functions are shared by many components within and beyond the system boundary. The operational environment of a system or component may impact the criticality including, for example, the connections to and dependencies on cyber-physical systems, devices, system-of-systems, and outsourced IT services. System components that allow unmediated access to critical system components or functions are considered critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities such components create. Component and function criticality are assessed in terms of the impact of a component or function failure on the organizational missions supported by the system containing those components and functions. A criticality analysis is performed when an architecture or design is being developed, modified, or upgraded. If done early in the system life cycle, organizations may consider modifying the system design to reduce the critical nature of these components and functions by, for example, adding redundancy or alternate paths into the system design.

SA-5:supplement:This control helps organizational personnel understand the implementation and operation of security <ins>and priva</ins>c<ins>y c</ins>ontrols associated with <del>information </del>systems, system components, and <del>information </del>system services. Organizations consider establishing specific measures to determine the quality<del>/</del><ins> and </ins>completeness of the content provided. <ins>System documentation may be used, for example, to support the management of supply chain risk, incident response, and other functions. Personnel or roles requiring documentation may include, for example, system owners, system security officers, and system administrators. Attempts to obtain documentation may include, for example, directly contacting manufacturers or suppliers and conducting web-based searches. </ins>The inability to obtain needed documentation may occur, for example, due to the age of the <del>information </del>system<del>/</del><ins> or </ins>component or lack of support from developers and contractors.

The level of protection provided for <del>selec</del>t<ins>h</ins>e<del>d</del> <del>information </del>system, component, or service documentation is commensurate with the security category or classification of the system. <del>For example, documentation associated with a key </del>Do<del>D weapons system or </del>c<del>ommand and control system wo</del>u<del>ld typically require a higher level of protection than a routine ad</del>m<del>inistrativ</del>e<del> system.

SA-9 (3):supplement:The degree of confidence that the risk from using external services is at an acceptable level depends on the trust that organizations place in the external providers, individually or in combination. Trust relationships can help organization<ins>s</ins> to gain increased levels of confidence that participating service providers are providing adequate protection for the services rendered. <del>S</del><ins>They can also be </ins>u<ins>seful when </ins>c<ins>onducting incident response or w</ins>h<ins>en</ins> <ins>planning fo</ins>r<ins> upgrad</ins>e<ins>s or obso</ins>l<ins>escence. Trust rel</ins>ationships can be complicated due to the number of potential entities participating in the consumer-provider interactions, subordinate relationships and levels of trust, and t<del>he t</del>ypes of interactions between the parties. In some cases, the degree of trust is based on the <del>amount</del><ins>level</ins> of <del>dire</del>c<del>t c</del>ontrol organizations <ins>c</ins>a<del>re</del><ins>n</ins> <del>abl</del>e<del> to e</del>xert on external service providers <del>with </del>regard<ins>ing</ins> t<del>o </del><ins>h</ins>e<del>mployment</del> <del>of se</del>c<del>urity c</del>ontrols necessary for the protection of the service<del>/</del><ins>, </ins>information<ins>,</ins> <ins>or individu</ins>a<ins>l privacy a</ins>nd the evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of th<del>os</del>e <ins>implemented </ins>controls.

For example, separately authorized external information system services provided to organizations through well</del><ins>SA</ins>-<del>established business relationships may provide degrees of trust in such services within the tolerable risk range of the organizations using the services. External service providers may also outsource selected services to other external entities, making the trust relationship more difficult and complicated to manage. Depending on the nature of the services, organizations may find it very difficult to place significant trust in external providers. This is not due to any inherent untrustworthiness on the part of providers, but to the intrinsic level of risk in the services</del><ins>12</ins>.

SA-11 (8):text:<del>Th</del><ins>R</ins>e<del> organization re</del>quire<del>s</del> the developer of the <del>information </del>system, system component, or<del> information</del> system service to employ dynamic code analysis tools to identify common flaws and document the results of the analysis.
SA-11 (8):supplement:Dynamic code analysis provides run-time verification of software programs, using tools capable of monitoring programs for memory corruption, user privilege issues, and other potential security problems. Dynamic code analysis employs run-time tools to <del>h</del>e<del>lp to e</del>nsure that security functionality performs in the <del>m</del><ins>w</ins>a<del>nner</del><ins>y</ins> i<del>n which i</del>t was designed. A specialized type of dynamic analysis, known as fuzz testing, induces program failures by deliberately introducing malformed or random data into software programs. Fuzz testing strategies derive from the intended use of applications and the <ins>associated </ins>functional and design specifications for the applications. To understand the scope of dyn<del>m</del>a<ins>m</ins>ic code analysis and hence the assurance provided, organizations may also consider conducting code coverage analysis (checking the degree to which the code has been tested using metrics such as percent of subroutines tested or p<del>r</del>e<ins>r</ins>cent of program statements called during execution of the test suite) and/or concordance analysis (checking for words that are out of place in software code such as non-English language words or derogatory terms)<ins>.

SA-12 (16):supplement:<ins>Every system and system component has a point of origin and may be changed throughout its existence. Provenance is the chronology of the origin, development, ownership, location, and changes to a system or system component and associated data. It may also include personnel and processes used to interact with or make modifications to the system, component, or associated data. Organizations consider developing procedures for allocating responsibilities for the creation, maintenance, and monitoring of provenance for systems and components; transferring provenance documentation and responsibility between organizations; and preventing and monitoring for unauthorized changes to the provenance records. Organizations consider developing methods to document, monitor, and maintain valid provenance baselines for systems, system components, and related data. Such actions help track, assess, and document changes to the provenance, including changes in supply chain elements or configuration, and ensure non-repudiation of provenance information and the provenance change records.

SA-13:supplement:<del>This control helps organizations to make explicit trustworthiness decisions when designing, developing, and implementing information systems that are needed to conduct critical organizational missions/business functions. Trustworthiness is a characteristic/property of an information system that expresses the degree to which the system can be expected to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information it processes, stores, or transmits. Trustworthy information systems are systems that are capable of being trusted to operate within defined levels of risk despite the environmental disruptions, human errors, and purposeful attacks that are expected to occur in the specified environments of operation. Trustworthy systems are important to mission/business success. Two factors affecting the trustworthiness of information systems include: (i) security functionality (i.e., the security features, functions, and/or mechanisms employed within the system and its environment of operation); and (ii) security assurance (i.e., the grounds for confidence that the security functionality is effective in its application). Developers, implementers, operators, and maintainers of organizational information systems can increase the level of assurance (and trustworthiness), for example, by employing well-defined security policy models, structured and rigorous hardware, software, and firmware development techniques, sound system/security engineering principles, and secure configuration settings (defined by a set of assurance-related security controls in Appendix E). Assurance is also based on the assessment of evidence produced during the system development life cycle. Critical missions/business functions are supported by high-impact systems and the associated assurance requirements for such systems. The additional assurance controls in Table E-4 in Appendix E (designated as optional) can be used to develop and implement high-assurance solutions for specific information systems and system components using the concept of overlays described in Appendix I. Organizations select assurance overlays that have been developed, validated, and approved for community adoption (e.g., cross-organization, governmentwide), limiting the development of such overlays on an organization-by-organization basis. Organizations can conduct criticality analyses as described in SA-14, to determine the information systems, system components, or information system services that require high-assurance solutions. Trustworthiness requirements and assurance overlays can be described in the security plans for organizational information systems. Related controls: RA-2, SA-4, SA-8, SA-14, SC-3.</del>

SA-14:supplement:<del>Criticality analysis is a key tenet of supply chain risk management and informs the prioritization of supply chain protection activities such as attack surface reduction, use of all-source intelligence, and tailored acquisition strategies. Information system engineers can conduct an end-to-end functional decomposition of an information system to identify mission-critical functions and components. The functional decomposition includes the identification of core organizational missions supported by the system, decomposition into the specific functions to perform those missions, and traceability to the hardware, software, and firmware components that implement those functions, including when the functions are shared by many components within and beyond the information system boundary. Information system components that allow for unmediated access to critical components or functions are considered critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities such components create. Criticality is assessed in terms of the impact of the function or component failure on the ability of the component to complete the organizational missions supported by the information system. A criticality analysis is performed whenever an architecture or design is being developed or modified, including upgrades.

SC-3:supplement:The <del>information </del>system isolates security functions from nonsecurity functions by means of an isolation boundary <del>(</del>implemented via partitions and domains<del>)</del>. Such isolation controls access to and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and firmware that perform those security functions. <del>Information s</del><ins>S</ins>ystems implement code separation <del>(</del>i<del>.e., separatio</del>n <del>of security functions fro</del>m<del> </del><ins>a</ins>n<del>onsecurit</del>y <del>functions) in a number of </del>ways, <del>including, </del>for example, through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes.

SC-30:supplement:Concealment and misdirection techniques can significantly reduce the targeting capability of adversaries (i.e., window of opportunity and available attack surface) to initiate and complete <del>cyber </del>attacks. For example, virtualization techniques provide organizations with the ability to disguise <del>information </del>systems, potentially reducing the likelihood of successful attacks without the cost of having multiple platforms. Increased use of concealment<del>/</del><ins> and </ins>misdirection techniques <ins>and methods </ins>including, for example, randomness, uncertainty, and virtualization, may sufficiently confuse and mislead adversaries and subsequently increase the risk of discovery and/or exposing tradecraft. Concealment<del>/</del><ins> and </ins>misdirection techniques may also provide organizations additional time to successfully perform core missions and business functions. Because of the time and effort required to support concealment<del>/</del><ins> and </ins>misdirection techniques, it is anticipated that such techniques would be used by organizations on a very limited basis.

SC-30 (2):supplement:Randomness introduces increased levels of uncertainty for adversaries regarding the actions organizations take in defending <ins>their systems </ins>against <del>cyber </del>attacks. Such actions may impede the ability of adversaries to correctly target information resources of organizations supporting critical missions<del>/</del><ins> or </ins>business functions.

SC-40:supplement:This control applies to internal and external wireless communication links that may be visible to individuals who are not authorized <del>information </del>system users. Adversaries can exploit the signal parameters of wireless links if such links are not adequately protected. There are many ways to exploit the signal parameters of wireless links to gain intelligence, deny service, or <del>to </del>spoof users of organizational <del>information </del>systems. This control reduces the impact of attacks that are unique to wireless systems. If organizations rely on commercial service providers for transmission services as commodity items rather than as fully dedicated services, it may not be possible to implement this control.

SC-40 (1):supplement:This control enhancement protects against intentional jamming that might deny or impair communications by ensuring that wireless spread spectrum waveforms used to provide anti-jam protection are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. The control enhancement may also coincidentally help to mitigate the effects of unintentional jamming due to interference from legitimate transmitters sharing the same spectrum.

Software applications typically follow well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information.

Consequently, the module or component that receives the <ins>corrup</ins>t<del>aint</del>ed output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

SI-20:title:<ins>DE-IDENTIFICATION</ins>
SI-20:text:<ins>Remove personally identifiable information from datasets.</ins>
SI-20:supplement:<ins>Many datasets contain information about individuals that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, or biometric records. Datasets may also contain other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information. Personally identifiable information is removed from datasets by trained individuals when such information is not (or no longer) necessary to satisfy the requirements envisioned for the data. For example, if the dataset is only used to produce aggregate statistics, the identifiers that are not needed for producing those statistics are removed. Removing identifiers improves privacy protection, since information that is removed cannot be inadvertently disclosed or improperly used. Related Controls: PM-23, PM-24, PM-25, SI-18, SI-19.</ins>
SI-20 (1):title:<ins>DE-IDENTIFICATION | COLLECTION</ins>
SI-20 (1):text:<ins>De-identify the dataset upon collection by not collecting personally identifiable information.</ins>
SI-20 (1):supplement:<ins>If a data source contains personally identifiable information but the information will not be used, the dataset can be de-identified upon creation by simply not collecting the data elements containing the personally identifiable information. For example, if an organization does not intend to use the social security number of an applicant, then application forms do not ask for a social security number. Related Controls: None.</ins>
SI-20 (2):title:<ins>DE-IDENTIFICATION | ARCHIVING</ins>
SI-20 (2):text:<ins>Refrain from archiving personally identifiable information elements if those elements in a dataset will not be needed after the dataset is archived.</ins>
SI-20 (2):supplement:<ins>Datasets can be archived for many reasons. The envisioned purposes for the archived dataset are specified and if personally identifiable information elements are not required, the elements are not archived. For example, social security numbers may have been collected for record linkage, but the archived dataset may include the required elements from the linked records. In this case, it is not necessary to archive the social security numbers. Related Controls: None.</ins>

SI-20 (3):text:<ins>Remove personally identifiable information elements from a dataset prior to its release if those elements in the dataset do not need to be part of the data release.</ins>
SI-20 (3):supplement:<ins>Prior to releasing a dataset, a data custodian considers the intended uses of the released dataset and determines if it is necessary to release personally identifiable information. If it is not necessary, the personally identifiable information can be removed using de-identification techniques. Related Controls: None.</ins>
SI-20 (4):title:<ins>DE-IDENTIFICATION | REMOVAL, MASKING, ENCRYPTION, HASHING, OR REPLACEMENT OF DIRECT IDENTIFIERS</ins>
SI-20 (4):text:<ins>Remove, mask, encrypt, hash, or replace direct identifiers in a dataset.</ins>
SI-20 (4):supplement:<ins>There are many possible processes for removing direct identifiers from a dataset. Columns in a dataset that contain a direct identifier can be removed. In masking, the direct identifier is transformed into a repeating character, for example, XXXXXX or 999999. Identifiers can be encrypted or hashed, so that the linked records remain linked. In the case of encryption or hashing, algorithms are employed that require the use of a key, including, for example, the Advanced Encryption Standard or a Hash-based Message Authentication Code. Implementations may use the same key for all identifiers or a different key for each identifier. Using a different key for each identifier provides for a higher degree of security and privacy. Identifiers can alternatively be replaced with a keyword, including for example, transforming “George Washington” to “PATIENT,” or replaced with a realistic surrogate value, including for example, transforming “George Washington” to “Abraham Polk.” Related Controls: None.</ins>

SI-20 (5):text:<ins>Manipulate numerical data, contingency tables, and statistical findings so that no person or organization is identifiable in the results of the analysis.</ins>
SI-20 (5):supplement:<ins>Many types of statistical analyses can result in the disclosure of information about individuals even if only summary information is provided. For example, if a school publishes a monthly table with the number of minority students, and in January the school reports that it has 10-19 such students, but in March it reports that it has 20-29 such students, then it can be inferred that the student who enrolled in February was a minority. Related Controls: None.</ins>
SI-20 (6):title:<ins>DE-IDENTIFICATION | DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY</ins>
SI-20 (6):text:<ins>Prevent disclosure of personally identifiable information by adding non-deterministic noise to the results of mathematical operations before the results are reported.</ins>
SI-20 (6):supplement:<ins>The mathematical definition for differential privacy holds that the result of a dataset analysis should be approximately the same before and after the addition or removal of a single data record (which is assumed to be the data from a single individual). In its most basic form, differential privacy applies only to online query systems. However, it can also be used to produce machine-learning statistical classifiers and synthetic data. Differential privacy comes at the cost of decreased accuracy of results, forcing organizations to quantify the trade-off between privacy protection and the overall accuracy, usefulness, and utility of the de-identified dataset. Non-deterministic noise can include, for example, adding small random values to the results of mathematical operations in dataset analysis. Related Controls: None.</ins>
SI-20 (7):title:<ins>DE-IDENTIFICATION | VALIDATED SOFTWARE</ins>
SI-20 (7):text:<ins>Perform de-identification using validated algorithms and software that is validated to implement the algorithms.</ins>
SI-20 (7):supplement:<ins>Algorithms that appear to remove personally identifiable information from a dataset may in fact leave information that is personally identifiable or data that are re-identifiable. Software that is claimed to implement a validated algorithm may contain bugs or may implement a different algorithm. Software may de-identify one type of data, for example, integers, but not another type of data, for example, floating point numbers. For these reasons, de-identification is performed using algorithms and software that are validated. Related Controls: None.</ins>
SI-20 (8):title:<ins>DE-IDENTIFICATION | MOTIVATED INTRUDER</ins>
SI-20 (8):text:<ins>Perform a motivated intruder test on the de-identified dataset to determine if the identified data remains or if the de-identified data can be re-identified.</ins>
SI-20 (8):supplement:<ins>A motivated intruder test is a test in which a person or group takes a data release and specified resources and attempts to re-identify one or more individuals in the de-identified dataset. Such tests specify the amount of inside knowledge, financial resources, computational resources, data, and skills that intruders have at their disposal to conduct the tests. A motivated intruder test can identify if de-identification is insufficient. It can also be a useful diagnostic tool to assess if de-identification is likely to be sufficient; however, the test alone cannot prove that de-identification is sufficient.
