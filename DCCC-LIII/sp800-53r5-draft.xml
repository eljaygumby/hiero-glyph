<H1 id="LinkTarget_86548" xml:lang="EN-US">This publication provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for federal information systems and organizations to protect organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation from a diverse set of threats including hostile attacks, natural disasters, structural failures, human errors, and privacy risks. The controls are flexible and customizable and implemented as part of an organization-wide process to manage risk. The controls address diverse requirements derived from mission and business needs, laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. The publication describes how to develop specialized sets of controls, or overlays, tailored for specific types of missions and business functions, technologies, environments of operation, and sector-specific applications. Finally, the consolidated catalog of controls addresses security and privacy from a functionality perspective (i.e., the strength of functions and mechanisms) and an assurance perspective (i.e., the measure of confidence in the security or privacy capability). Addressing both functionality and assurance ensures that information technology products and the information systems that rely on those products are sufficiently trustworthy. </H1>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Notes to Reviewers </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">As we push computers to "the edge" building an increasingly complex world of interconnected information systems and devices, security and privacy continue to dominate the national dialog. The Defense Science Board in its 2017 report, 
<Link xml:lang="EN-US">Task Force on Cyber Defense</Link>
, provides a sobering assessment of the current vulnerabilities in the U.S. critical infrastructure and the information systems that support the mission essential operations and assets in the public and private sectors. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">"…The Task Force notes that the cyber threat to U.S. critical infrastructure is outpacing </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">efforts to reduce pervasive vulnerabilities, so that for the next decade at least the United States </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">must lean significantly on deterrence to address the cyber threat posed by the most capable </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">U.S. adversaries. It is clear that a more proactive and systematic approach to U.S. cyber </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">deterrence is urgently needed…" </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">There is an urgent need to further strengthen the underlying information systems, component products, and services that we depend on in every sector of the critical infrastructure-ensuring those systems, components, and services are sufficiently trustworthy and provide the necessary resilience to support the economic and national security interests of the United States. This update to NIST Special Publication 800-53 (Revision 5) responds to the call by the Defense Science Board by embarking on a proactive and systemic approach to develop and make available to a broad base of public and private sector organizations, a comprehensive set of safeguarding measures for all types of computing platforms, including general purpose computing systems, cyber-physical systems, cloud and mobile systems, industrial/process control systems, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Those safeguarding measures include security and privacy controls to protect the critical and essential operations and assets of organizations and the personal privacy of individuals. The ultimate objective is to make the information systems we depend on more penetration resistant to attacks; limit the damage from attacks when they occur; and make the systems resilient and survivable. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Revision 5 of this foundational NIST publication represents a one-year effort to develop the next generation security and privacy controls that will be needed to accomplish the above objectives. It includes changes to make the controls more consumable by diverse consumer groups including, for example, enterprises conducting mission and business operations; engineering organizations developing information systems and systems-of-systems; and industry partners building system components, products, and services. The major changes to the publication include: </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">In developing standards and guidelines required by FISMA, NIST consults with federal agencies, state, local, and tribal governments, and private sector organizations to improve information security and privacy; avoid unnecessary and costly duplication of effort; and ensure that its publications are complementary with the standards and guidelines used for the protection of national security systems. In addition to a comprehensive and transparent public review and vetting process, NIST is engaged in a collaborative partnership with the Office of Management and Budget, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Department of Defense, Committee on National Security Systems, and the Federal Privacy Council-and has established a risk management framework applicable to both information security and privacy for the federal government. This common foundation for security and privacy provides the Civil, Defense, and Intelligence Communities of the federal government and their contractors, more cost-effective, flexible, and consistent ways to manage security and privacy risks to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. The unified framework also provides a strong basis for reciprocal acceptance of authorization decisions and facilitate information sharing and collaboration. NIST continues to work with public and private sector entities to establish mappings and relationships between the information security and privacy standards and guidelines developed by NIST and those developed by external organizations. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">With a renewed nation-wide emphasis on the use of trustworthy information systems and supply chain security, it is essential that organizations can express their security and privacy requirements with clarity and specificity in order to engage the information technology industry and obtain the systems, components, and services necessary for mission and business success. Accordingly, this publication provides controls in the System and Services Acquisition (SA) family that address requirements for the development of information systems, system components, and system services. To that end, many of the controls in the SA family are directed at developers of those systems, components, and services. It is important for organizations to recognize that the scope of the controls in that family includes information system, component, and service development and the developers associated with such development whether the development is conducted internally or externally by industry partners (manufacturers, vendors, integrators) through the contracting and acquisition processes. The affected controls in the control catalog include SA-8, SA-10, SA-11, SA-15, SA-16, SA-17, SA-20, and SA-21. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">INFORMATION SYSEMS - A BROAD-BASED PERSPECTIVE </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">As we push computers to "the edge" building an increasingly complex world of interconnected information systems and devices, security and privacy continue to dominate the national dialog. There is an urgent need to further strengthen the underlying information systems, component products, and services that we depend on in every sector of the critical infrastructure-ensuring those systems, components, and services are sufficiently trustworthy and provide the necessary resilience to support the economic and national security interests of the United States. NIST Special Publication 800-53 (Revision 5) responds to this need by embarking on a proactive and systemic approach to develop and make available to a broad base of public and private sector organizations, a comprehensive set of security and privacy safeguarding measures for all types of computing platforms, including general purpose computing systems; cyber-physical systems; cloud and mobile systems; industrial and process control systems; and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Those safeguarding measures include both security and privacy controls to protect the critical and essential operations and assets of organizations and personal privacy of individuals. The ultimate objective is to make the information systems we depend on more penetration resistant to attacks; limit the damage from attacks when they occur; and make the systems resilient and survivable. </P>

Privacy controls are the administrative, technical, and physical safeguards employed within an agency to ensure compliance with applicable privacy requirements and to manage privacy risks. Security and privacy controls are selected and implemented to satisfy a set of defined security and privacy requirements and to manage risk.

<P xml:lang="EN-US">This publication establishes a set of controls with the breadth and depth to satisfy a diverse set of requirements, including security and privacy requirements,
<Link>15</Link>
 that have been levied on information systems and organizations-and that are consistent with and complementary to other established national and international security and privacy standards. To develop a broadly applicable and technically sound set of controls for information systems and organizations, many sources were considered during the development of this publication. These sources included requirements and controls from the defense, financial, healthcare, intelligence, manufacturing, industrial control, and audit communities as well as national and international standards organizations. The security and privacy controls in this publication have been mapped to international security and privacy standards to help ensure maximum usability and applicability. In addition, the controls in this publication have been mapped to the requirements for federal information systems included in OMB Circular A-130, Managing Information as a Strategic Resource.

<P xml:lang="EN-US">The security and privacy controls described in this publication represent the state-of-the-practice protection measures for individuals, information systems, and organizations. The controls are reviewed and revised periodically to reflect the experience gained from using the controls; new or revised laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, and standards; changing security and privacy requirements; emerging threats, vulnerabilities, attack and information processing methods; and the availability of new technologies. The security and privacy controls in the control catalog are also expected to change over time as controls are withdrawn, revised, and added. In addition to the need for change, the need for stability is addressed by requiring that proposed modifications to security and privacy controls go through a rigorous and transparent public review process to obtain public and private sector feedback and to build a consensus for such change. This provides a stable, flexible, and technically sound set of security and privacy controls for the organizations that use the control catalog. </P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_86260" xml:lang="EN-US">2.1   REQUIREMENTS AND CONTROLS </H2>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Before embarking on the process of selecting security and privacy controls, it is important to understand the relationship between controls and requirements.
<Link>19</Link>
 A requirement is a statement that translates or expresses a specific need including associated constraints and conditions.
<Link>20</Link>
 A requirement levied on an information system or an organization can be derived from different sources, including for example, laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and mission/business needs. Requirements address the capability the information system is designed to provide, for example, processing payroll transactions, simulating weather patterns, controlling industrial processes, or performing genome sequencing for advanced medical research. </P>

<Footnote>
<P xml:lang="EN-US">19 There is no single, prescribed, or mandatory relationship between requirements and controls. The relationship is completely dependent on the organization's use of controls, which may be dynamic and evolving. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">20 See 
<Link xml:lang="EN-US">ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148</Link>
. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">21 In accordance with 
<Link xml:lang="EN-US">OMB Circular A-130</Link>
, security controls are the safeguards or countermeasures prescribed for an information system or an organization to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information. Privacy controls are the administrative, technical, and physical safeguards employed within an agency to ensure compliance with applicable privacy requirements and manage privacy risks. </P>
</Footnote>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Security and privacy requirements are a subset of the requirements that can be levied on an information system or organization. Security requirements ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information being processed, stored, or transmitted by the information system. Privacy requirements advance individual privacy associated with an organizations's creation, collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, or disposal of personally identifiable information. Such requirements can be used in a variety of contexts from policy- and oversight-related activities to life cycle-related activities that involve information systems development and engineering disciplines. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Security and privacy controls for information systems and organizations help satisfy security and privacy requirements.  Controls can be used in a variety of contexts and can serve many purposes. When used in the security and privacy context, controls
<Link>21</Link>
 are designed to address the protection needs of organizations, information systems, and individuals. Such needs are specified by a set of security and privacy requirements. Security and privacy controls help an organization satisfy security and privacy requirements and defined security and privacy policies. It is important to understand the complementary nature of requirements and controls and how they work together to protect organizations, information systems, and individuals. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Finally, information systems represent a complex machine-human environment, and as such, the functions of the systems can be realized by technological and human elements. Accordingly, the mechanisms implementing security and privacy controls in information systems can include both technical and non-technical (i.e., administrative) controls. These controls are represented in the broad array of families in the consolidated control catalog in Chapter Three. In addition, security and privacy controls can be employed in a variety of contexts supported by different types of risk-based decision processes. For example, the controls may be used as part of the Risk Management Framework
<Link>22</Link>
 or a comprehensive, life cycle-based systems engineering process.
<Link>23</Link>
 Controls can be viewed as generalized statements that express the security and privacy functions or capabilities necessary to ensure compliance with applicable requirements and to manage risk.  </P>

<Link xml:lang="EN-US">FIPS Publication 200</Link>
. In addition to those families, three other families address privacy and program management considerations. </P>
</Footnote>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Irrespective of how organizations define the terms requirement and control, it is important for organizations to clearly establish the relationship so that expectations for security and privacy can be achieved given stakeholder protection needs and concerns for individual privacy; assumptions; constraints placed upon organizations; trade-space decisions; cost, schedule, and performance considerations; and risk management decisions. </P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_86249" xml:lang="EN-US">2.2   CONTROL STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZATION </H2>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Security and privacy controls described in this publication have a well-defined organization and structure. For ease of use in the security and privacy control selection and specification process, controls are organized into twenty families.
<Link>24</Link>
 Each family contains security and privacy controls related to the specific topic of the family. A two-character identifier uniquely identifies each control family, for example, PS (Personnel Security). Security and privacy controls may involve aspects of policy, oversight, supervision, manual processes, and automated mechanisms that are implemented by systems or actions by individuals. Table 1 lists the security and privacy control families and their associated family identifiers.   </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Security and privacy controls have the following structure: a base control section; a supplemental guidance section; a control enhancements section; a related controls section; and a references section. The control section prescribes a security or privacy capability to be implemented. Such capability is achieved by the activities or actions, automated or nonautomated, carried out by information systems, organizations, and individuals. Organizations designate the responsibility for control design, implementation, management, and monitoring. Organizations have flexibility to implement the controls selected in whatever manner that satisfies the organizational mission or business needs, consistent with law, regulation, and policy. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">For some security and privacy controls in the control catalog, a degree of flexibility is provided by allowing organizations to define specific values for designated parameters associated with the controls. This flexibility is achieved as part of a tailoring process using assignment and selection statements embedded within the controls and enclosed by brackets. These parameter statements give organizations the capability to customize controls based on stakeholder security and privacy requirements. The requirements can evolve from a variety of sources including, for example, mission and business needs, laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, guidelines, or industry best practices. Risk assessments and organizational risk tolerance are also important factors in defining the values for control parameters.
<Link>25</Link>
 While the parameter statements provide flexibility, organizations are responsible for choosing and assigning the parameters for each selected control. Once specified, the values for the assignment and selection statements become a permanent part of the control. The implementation of the control is assessed against the completed control statement. In contrast to assignment statements, selection statements narrow the range of potential input values by providing a specific list of items from which organizations must choose.  </P>

<Footnote>
<P xml:lang="EN-US">25 In general, organization-defined parameters used in assignment and selection statements in the base security and privacy controls apply also to the control enhancements associated with those controls. </P>
</Footnote>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">The supplemental guidance section provides non-prescriptive, additional information for a security or privacy control. Organizations can apply the guidance as needed, when defining, developing, implementing, or assessing controls. The supplemental guidance provides important considerations for implementing controls in the context of mission or business requirements, operational environments, or assessments of risk. Supplemental guidance can also explain the purpose or meaning of controls and often includes examples. Control enhancements may also contain supplemental guidance. This occurs when the guidance is not applicable to the entire control but instead is focused on the control enhancement. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">The related controls section provides a list of security or privacy controls that directly impact or support the implementation of a control or control enhancement. Security and privacy control enhancements are related to their base control. Related controls that are referenced in the base control are not repeated in the control enhancements. There may, however, be related controls identified for control enhancements that are not referenced in the base control (i.e., the related control is only associated with that specific control enhancement). </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">The control enhancements section provides statements of security and privacy capability to add functionality or specificity to a base control or to increase the strength of a base control. In both cases, the control enhancements are used in information systems and environments of operation that require greater protection than provided by the base control due to the potential adverse organizational or individual impacts or when organizations require additions to the base control functionality or assurance based on organizational assessments of risk. Control enhancements are numbered sequentially within each control so that the enhancements can be easily identified when selected to supplement the base control. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Each control enhancement has a short subtitle to indicate the intended function or capability provided by the enhancement. In the AU-4 example, if the control enhancement is selected, the control designation becomes AU-4(1). The numerical designation of a control enhancement is used only to identify that enhancement within the control. The designation is not indicative of the strength of the control enhancement, level or degree of protection, or any hierarchical relationship among the enhancements. Control enhancements are not intended to be selected independently. That is, if a control enhancement is selected, then the corresponding base control must also be selected and implemented. This intent is reflected in the control baselines in

<H2 id="LinkTarget_86026" xml:lang="EN-US">2.3   TYPES OF CONTROLS </H2>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">There are three distinct types of security and privacy controls in 
<Reference xml:lang="EN-US">Chapter Three</Reference>
. These include: common controls, system-specific controls, and hybrid controls. The control types define the scope of applicability for the control; the shared nature or inheritability of the control; and the responsibility for control development, implementation, assessment, and authorization. Each type of control has a specific focus and objective which helps organizations implement the controls effectively and obtain the expected protection benefits. Deploying certain types of controls may also achieve cost benefits by leveraging security and privacy capabilities across many information systems and environments of operation. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Common controls are security or privacy controls whose implementation results in a capability that is inheritable by multiple information systems or programs. Controls are deemed inheritable when the information system or program receives protection from the implemented control but the control is developed, implemented, assessed, authorized, and monitored by entities other than those responsible for the system or program. The security and privacy capabilities provided by common controls can be inherited from many sources including, for example, mission/business lines, organizations, enclaves, sites, environments of operation, or other information systems or programs. Many of the controls needed to protect information systems including, for example, physical and environmental protection controls, personal security controls, and many privacy controls, are candidates for common control status. Common controls can include technology-based controls, for example, boundary protection controls, access controls, identification and authentication controls, and controls that are part of cross-domain solutions. The development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring cost of common controls can be amortized across multiple information systems, programs, and organizational elements. </P>

<TextBox>
<P xml:lang="EN-US">COMMON CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">The selection of common controls is most effectively accomplished on an organization-wide basis with the involvement of the senior leadership who understand organizational priorities, the importance of organizational operations and assets, and the importance of the information systems that support those operations and assets. These senior leaders are in the best position to assign responsibilities for developing, implementing, assessing, authorizing, and monitoring common controls. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Organizations assign responsibility for common controls to appropriate officials. These officials, designated as common control providers, develop, implement, assess, authorize, and monitor the organization-defined common controls.
<Link>27</Link>
 The identification and selection of common controls is most effectively accomplished as an organization-wide exercise with the active involvement of executive-level personnel including, for example, mission and business owners, risk executives, authorizing officials, Chief Information Officers, Senior Agency Information Security Officers, Senior Agency Officials for Privacy, information owners or information stewards, system owners, and other key stakeholders. The organization-wide common control selection process considers the security and privacy controls necessary to adequately respond to the risks arising from the use of the systems or program inheriting the controls.
<Link>28</Link>
 Common controls that affect multiple, but not all systems and programs within the organization, could benefit from taking a similar approach. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">27 Organizational officials at the senior leadership level assign responsibility for the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring of common controls to appropriate entities. Such entities can be internal or external to the organization. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">28 Each potential common control is reviewed for applicability to each organizational system or program. </P>
</Footnote>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Common controls are documented in organization-wide security and privacy program plans. The controls may also be documented in the security and privacy plans for information systems that inherit those controls or in situations where the common controls are implemented within specific systems.
<Link>29</Link>
 Organizations can describe common controls in a single document or in multiple documents with references to other documents, as appropriate. If program plans contain multiple documents, organizations specify in each document the officials responsible for development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring of the respective common controls. When common controls are included in a separate security or privacy plan for an information system, the security or privacy program plans indicate which separate security or privacy plans contain a description of the common controls. </P>

<Footnote>
<P xml:lang="EN-US">29 Organizations ensure that any security or privacy capabilities provided by common controls (i.e., security or privacy capabilities inheritable by other organizational entities) are described in sufficient detail to facilitate understanding of the control implementation by inheriting entities. </P>
</Footnote>

<P xml:lang="EN-US"> </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Security and privacy controls not designated as common controls are considered system-specific or hybrid controls. System-specific controls are the primary responsibility of information system owners and the authorizing officials for those systems. Organizations can designate a security or privacy control as hybrid if one part of the control is common and another part of the control is system-specific. For example, an organization may implement the Contingency Planning control using a predefined template for the master contingency plan for all organizational information systems with individual information system owners tailoring the plan for system-specific uses, where appropriate. The division of hybrid controls into common and system-specific parts may vary by organization, depending on the types of information technologies employed, assignment of responsibilities, and the methods used by the organization to manage its controls. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">INHERITED RISK </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Organizations consider the inherited risk from the use of common controls. Security and privacy plans, security and privacy assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones for common controls (or a summary of such information) are made available to information system owners (for information systems inheriting the controls) after the information is reviewed and approved by the senior official or executive responsible and accountable for the common controls. It is therefore important that both internal and external common control providers keep common control status information current. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">The determination as to whether a security or privacy control is a common, hybrid, or system-specific control is context-dependent. Security and privacy controls cannot be determined to be common, hybrid, or system-specific simply based on reviewing the language of the control. For example, a control may be designated as a system-specific control for one information system, and at the same time be designated as a common control for another information system (i.e., inheriting the control from the first system). One method to determine if a system-specific control may also be designated as a common control for other information systems is to consider who or what depends on the functionality of that control. If a certain part of an information system or solution external to the system depends on the control, then that control may be a candidate for common control status. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Partitioning security and privacy controls into common, hybrid, and system-specific controls can result in significant savings to organizations in implementation and assessment costs as well as a more consistent application of controls organization-wide. While the partitioning of controls into common, hybrid, and system-specific controls is straightforward and intuitive conceptually, the actual application takes planning and coordination. It is necessary to first determine what security and privacy capabilities are needed before organizations assign specific responsibility for how the security and privacy controls are implemented, operated, and maintained. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">While security and privacy requirements are authoritatively sourced to different laws, regulations, or policies, there is also a strong relationship between the security and privacy domains. One of the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs) is security-a key principle to help ensure the protection of personally identifiable information and individual privacy. Therefore, controls used to manage the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems when selected and implemented for information systems that create, collect, use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, disclose, or dispose of personally identifiable information, address security and privacy concerns. Nonetheless, individual privacy cannot be achieved solely through securing personally identifiable information. Consequently, this publication contains controls designed to meet privacy requirements and to manage the privacy risks associated with an organizations's creation, collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, or disposal of personally identifiable information separate from security concerns. Figure 1 illustrates the totality of security and privacy concerns, reflecting common areas of concern and those areas of concern that are unique. </P>

<Reference xml:lang="EN-US">Appendix F</Reference>
 provides a summary of the privacy controls and control enhancements predominantly for addressing unique privacy concerns. Appendix F is intended to help organizations identify the controls and control enhancements for which privacy programs have primary responsibility. For some controls and enhancements, the selection authority and oversight is shared with the security programs. These controls and controls enhancements are designated as joint controls-that is, the controls and control enhancements can address security and privacy requirements. In those situations, organizations may opt to do a joint implementation or alternatively, the privacy program and security program may implement the respective privacy and security aspects of the control or enhancement separately. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">For example, in joint control AT-2, the privacy program may develop and conduct separate privacy-focused training or it could choose to develop coordinated privacy and security training with the security program. For controls and control enhancements that are not considered joint, privacy programs have the sole authority to select and oversee the controls and enhancements. In addition to Appendix F, the security and privacy tables in 
<Reference xml:lang="EN-US">Appendix E</Reference>
 indicate which privacy controls are considered joint controls. However, organizations have the flexibility to identify other controls as privacy or joint controls, as appropriate. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Throughout the control catalog, there may be references to privacy controls or considerations in various security controls because in some contexts, these security controls could provide privacy protections or could create privacy risks depending on the implementation. Although security programs may be responsible for these controls, organizations may have privacy programs and security progams collaborate on how to manage the nexus with privacy. To maintain awareness and support collaboration between privacy and security programs, organizations may use the keywords in 
<Reference xml:lang="EN-US">Appendix H</Reference>

<H2 xml:lang="EN-US">2.5   CONTROL BASELINES </H2>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">A significant challenge for organizations is selecting a set of security and privacy controls which, if correctly implemented and determined to be effective, adequately responds to mission and business risk while complying with security and privacy requirements defined by applicable laws, Executive Orders, regulations, policies, and directives. There is no single set of controls that addresses all security and privacy concerns in every situation. However, choosing the most appropriate controls for a specific situation or system to adequately respond to risk requires a fundamental understanding of the organization's missions and business priorities; the mission and business functions the systems will support; and the environments where the systems will operate. It also requires close collaboration with key organizational stakeholders. With that understanding, organizations can demonstrate how to effectively and cost-effectively assure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational information and systems as well as the privacy of individuals in the context of supporting the organization's mission and business functions. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">To assist organizations in selecting the set of controls for their systems that is commensurate with risk, the concept of a control baseline is introduced. A control baseline is a collection of controls from 
<Reference xml:lang="EN-US">Chapter Three</Reference>
 specifically assembled or brought together to address the protection needs of a group, organization, or community of interest.
<Link>30</Link>
 The control baseline provides a generalized set of controls that represents an initial starting point for the subsequent tailoring activities that can be applied to the baseline to produce a more targeted or customized security and privacy solution for the entity it is intended to serve. The selection of controls for control baselines can be based on a variety of factors including, for example, sector-specific requirements, threat information, organizational assumptions and constraints, mission or business requirements, types of systems, operating environments, specific technologies, or laws, Executive Orders, regulations, policies, directives, standards, or industry best practices. The control baselines are tailored or customized </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">The trustworthiness of systems, system components, and system services is an important part of the risk management strategies developed by organizations. Whether systems are deployed to support the national air traffic control system, a major financial institution, a nuclear power plant, or the military services and warfighters, the systems must be reliable, trustworthy, and resilient in the face of increasingly sophisticated and pervasive threats-and also support the privacy of individuals. To understand how to achieve trustworthy systems and the role assurance plays, it is important to first define the term trustworthiness. Trustworthiness, in this context, means simply worthy of being trusted to fulfill whatever critical requirements may be needed for a particular component, subsystem, system, network, application, mission, business function, enterprise, or other entity.
<Link>31</Link>
 Trustworthiness requirements can include, for example, attributes of reliability, dependability, performance, resilience, safety, security, privacy, and survivability under a range of potential adversity in the form of disruptions, hazards, threats, and privacy risks. Effective measures of trustworthiness are meaningful only to the extent the requirements are sufficiently complete and well-defined, and can be accurately assessed.

Assurance is the measure of confidence that the system functionality is implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security and privacy requirements for the system-thus possessing the capability to accurately mediate and enforce established security and privacy policies. Security and privacy controls address both functionality and assurance. Some controls focus primarily on functionality. Other controls focus primarily on assurance.

The identification of authorized users of the system and the specification of access privileges reflects the requirements in other controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on system accounts receive additional scrutiny by appropriate organizational personnel responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access, including, for example, system owner, mission/business owner, or chief information security officer. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements and mission/business requirements. Failure to consider these factors could affect system availability. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Temporary and emergency accounts are intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts including, for example, local logon accounts used for special tasks or when network resources are unavailable. Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include, for example, when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required; or when individuals are transferred or terminated. Some types of system accounts may require specialized training. </P>

Dynamic privilege management can include, for example, immediate revocation of privileges from users, as opposed to requiring that users terminate and restart their sessions to reflect any changes in privileges. Dynamic privilege management can also include those mechanisms that change user privileges based on dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles. Examples include automatic adjustments of user privileges if they are operating out of their normal work times, their job function or assignment changes, or if systems are under duress or in emergency situations.

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Mandatory access control is a type of nondiscretionary access control. The above class of mandatory access control policies constrains what actions subjects can take with information obtained from data objects for which they have already been granted access. This prevents the subjects from passing the information to unauthorized subjects and objects. This class of mandatory access control policies also constrains what actions subjects can take with respect to the propagation of access control privileges; that is, a subject with a privilege cannot pass that privilege to other subjects. The policy is uniformly enforced over all subjects and objects to which the system has control. Otherwise, the access control policy can be circumvented. This enforcement is provided by an implementation that meets the reference monitor concept as described in AC-25. The policy is bounded by the system boundary (i.e., once the information is passed outside of the control of the system, additional means may be required to ensure that the constraints on the information remain in effect). </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">The trusted subjects described above are granted privileges consistent with the concept of least privilege (see AC-6).

The control is most applicable when there is a policy mandate that establishes a policy regarding access to controlled unclassified information or classified information and some users of the system are not authorized access to all such information resident in the system. This control can operate in conjunction with AC-3(4). A subject constrained in its operation by policies governed by this control is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of AC-3(4), but policies governed by this control take precedence over the less rigorous constraints of AC-3(4). For example, while a mandatory access control policy imposes a constraint preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity label, AC-3(4) permits the subject to pass the information to any subject with the same sensitivity label as the subject. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained regarding what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects. This control enhancement can operate in conjunction with AC-3(3). A subject that is constrained in its operation by policies governed by AC-3(3) is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this control enhancement. Therefore, while AC-3(3) imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, AC-3(4) permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the system boundary. Once the information is passed outside of the control of the system, additional means may be required to help ensure that the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control. </P>

Organizations can create specific roles based on job functions and the authorizations (i.e., privileges) to perform needed operations on the systems associated with the organization-defined roles. When users are assigned to the organizational roles, they inherit the authorizations or privileges defined for those roles. RBAC simplifies privilege administration for organizations because privileges are not assigned directly to every user (which can be a significant number of individuals for mid- to large-size organizations) but are instead acquired through role assignments. RBAC can be implemented either as a mandatory or discretionary form of access control. For organizations implementing RBAC with mandatory access controls, the requirements in AC-3(3) define the scope of the subjects and objects covered by the policy. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Systems can only protect organizational information within the confines of established system boundaries. Additional security controls may be needed to ensure that such information is adequately protected once it is passed beyond the established system boundaries. In situations where the system is unable to determine the adequacy of the protections provided by entities outside its boundary, as a mitigating control, organizations determine procedurally whether the external systems are providing adequate security. The means used to determine the adequacy of security provided by external systems include, for example, conducting inspections or periodic testing and assessments; establishing agreements between the organization and its counterpart organizations; or some other process.

Alternatively, if the system passes information to a printer in organization-controlled space, procedural means can be employed to ensure that only appropriately authorized individuals gain access to the printer.

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Enforce attribute-based access control policy over defined subjects and objects and control access based upon [Assignment: organization-defined attributes to assume access permissions]. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is an access control policy that restricts system access to authorized users based on their organizational attributes, such as job function; environmental attributes, such as time of day; and resource attributes, such as the classification of a document. Organizations can create specific rules based on attributes and the authorizations (i.e., privileges) to perform needed operations on the systems associated with the organization-defined attributes and rules. When users are assigned to attributes defined in ABAC policies or rules, they can be provisioned to a system with appropriate privileges or dynamically granted access to a protected resource upon access. ABAC can be implemented either as a mandatory or discretionary form of access control. For organizations implementing ABAC with mandatory access controls, the requirements in AC-3(3) define the scope of the subjects and objects covered by the policy. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Control:  Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between interconnected systems based on [Assignment: organization-defined information flow control policies]. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Information flow control regulates where information can travel within a system and between systems (as opposed to who is allowed to access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include, for example, keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, restricting web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring information between systems in different security domains with different security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information owners or stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes, for example, prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing access only); employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows; and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security labels. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations within systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering capability based on message content. Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering/inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 22 primarily address cross-domain solution needs which focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, for example, high-assurance guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf information technology products. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Information is represented internally within systems using abstractions known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are typically associated with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are typically associated with data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and communications ports. Security attributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions representing the basic properties or characteristics of active and passive entities with respect to safeguarding information. Privacy attributes, which may be used independently, or in conjunction with security attributes, represent the basic properties or characteristics of an entity with respect to the management of personally identifiable information. Such attributes are used to enable the implementation of the need for the record in the performance of duties, the identification of personal information within data objects, and the identification of permitted uses of personal information. Attributes can be explicitly or implicitly associated with the information contained in organizational systems or system components. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Security and privacy attributes may be associated with active entities (i.e., subjects) that have the potential to send or receive information, to cause information to flow among objects, or to change the system state. These attributes may also be associated with passive entities (i.e., objects) that contain or receive information. The association of security and privacy attributes to subjects and objects is referred to as binding and is inclusive of setting the attribute value and the attribute type. Security and privacy attributes when bound to data or information, enable the enforcement of security policies for access control and information flow control and privacy policies including, for example, for data retention limits and permitted uses of personally identifiable information. Such enforcement occurs through organizational processes or system functions or mechanisms. Binding techniques implemented by systems affect the strength of attribute binding to information. Binding strength and the assurance associated with binding techniques play an important part in the trust organizations have in the information flow enforcement process. The binding techniques affect the number and degree of additional reviews required by organizations. The content or assigned values of the security and privacy attributes can directly affect the ability of individuals to access organizational information. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Organizations can define the types of attributes needed for selected systems to support missions or business functions. There is potentially a wide range of values that can be assigned to any given security attribute. Release markings can include, for example, US only, NATO, or NOFORN (not releasable to foreign nationals). By specifying permitted attribute ranges and values, organizations ensure that the security and privacy attribute values are meaningful and relevant. Labeling refers to the association of security and privacy attributes with subjects and objects represented by the internal data structures within organizational systems. This facilitates system-based enforcement of information security and privacy policies. Labels include, for example, access authorizations, nationality, data life cycle protection (i.e., encryption and data expiration), data subject consents, permissible data uses, affiliation as contractor, and classification of information in accordance with legal and compliance requirements. Conversely, marking refers to the association of security and privacy attributes with objects in a human-readable form. This enables manual, procedural, or process-based enforcement of information security and privacy policies. Examples of attribute types include classification level for objects and clearance (access authorization) level for subjects. An attribute value for both attribute types is Top Secret. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Supplemental Guidance:  Remote access is access to organizational systems (or processes acting on behalf of users) communicating through external networks such as the Internet. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations often employ encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity over remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs provides sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as internal networks if the cryptographic mechanisms used are implemented in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can also affect the capability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote access controls apply to systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public access. This control addresses authorization prior to allowing remote access without specifying the specific formats for such authorization. While organizations may use interconnection security agreements to authorize remote access connections, such agreements are not required by this control. Enforcing access restrictions for remote connections is addressed in AC-3. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection; possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power source. Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones, E-readers, and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual and the device is usually near the individual; however, the degree of proximity can vary depending upon on the form factor and size of the device. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop systems, depending upon the nature and intended purpose of the device. Controlled areas are areas or spaces for which organizations provide sufficient physical or procedural safeguards to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes/types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include, for example, configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Usage restrictions and authorization to connect may vary among organizational systems. For example, the organization may authorize the connection of mobile devices to the organizational network and impose a set of usage restrictions while a system owner may withhold authorization for mobile device connection to specific applications or may impose additional usage restrictions before allowing mobile device connections to a system. The need to provide adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements in this control. Many safeguards for mobile devices are reflected in other security controls allocated to the initial control baselines as starting points for the development of security plans and overlays using the tailoring process. There may also be some overlap by the security controls within the different families of controls. AC-20 addresses mobile devices that are not organization-controlled. </P>

These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing sharing and trust agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between federal agencies or organizations subordinate to those agencies, or when such trust agreements are specified by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, or policies. Authorized individuals include, for example, organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior with regard to system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be uniform, as those restrictions may vary depending on the trust relationships between organizations.

In such instances, authorization information is transmitted securely so timely access control decisions can be enforced at the appropriate locations. To support the access control decisions, it may be necessary to transmit as part of the access authorization information, supporting security attributes. This is because in distributed systems, there are various access control decisions that need to be made and different entities make these decisions in a serial fashion, each requiring security attributes to make the decisions. Protecting access authorization information ensures that such information cannot be altered, spoofed, or compromised during transmission. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US"> Control:  Implement a reference monitor for [Assignment: organization-defined access control policies] that is tamperproof, always invoked, and small enough to be subject to analysis and testing, the completeness of which can be assured. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Information is represented internally within systems using abstractions known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are associated with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are typically associated with data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and communications ports. Reference monitors enforce mandatory access control policies, a type of access control that restricts access to objects based on the identity of subjects or groups to which the subjects belong. The access controls are mandatory because subjects with certain privileges (i.e., access permissions) are restricted from passing those privileges on to any other subjects, either directly or indirectly-that is, the system strictly enforces the access control policy based on the rule set established by the policy. The tamperproof property of the reference monitor prevents adversaries from compromising the functioning of the mechanism. The always invoked property prevents adversaries from bypassing the mechanism and hence violating the security policy. The smallness property helps to ensure the completeness in the analysis and testing of the mechanism to detect weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e., latent flaws) that would prevent the enforcement of the security policy. </P>

The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and procedures. Comprehensive policy and procedures help provide security and privacy assurance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. The procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. It is important to recognize that restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure. </P>

</LI>

</LI>
</L>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  An event is any observable occurrence in an organizational system. Organizations identify audit event types as those events which are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the environments in which those systems operate to meet specific and ongoing audit needs. Audit event types can include, for example, password changes; failed logons or failed accesses related to systems; security attribute changes, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, query parameters, or external credential usage. In determining the set of auditable event types, organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of the security controls to be implemented. To balance auditing requirements with other system needs, this control also requires identifying that subset of auditable event types that are audited at a given point in time. For example, organizations may determine that systems must have the capability to log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Auditing requirements, including the need for auditable events, may be referenced in other security and privacy controls and control enhancements for example, AC-2(4), AC-3(10), AC-6(9), AC-16(11), AC-17(1), CM-3.f, CM-5(1), IA-3(3.b), MA-4(1), MP-4(2), PA-4.d, PE-3, PM-22, RA-8, SC-7(9), SC-7(15), SI-3(8), SI-4(22), SI-7(8), and SI-10(1). Organizations also include auditable event types that are required by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Audit records can be generated at various levels, including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of auditing is an important aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems. Organizations consider in the definition of auditable event types, the auditing necessary to cover related event types such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes and actions that occur in service-oriented architectures. </P>

The use of standardized audit record analysis scripts developed by organizations (with localized script adjustments, as necessary) provides more cost-effective approaches for analyzing audit record information collected. The correlation of audit record information with vulnerability scanning information is important in determining the veracity of vulnerability scans and correlating attack detection events with scanning results. Correlation with performance data can uncover denial of service attacks or other types of attacks resulting in unauthorized use of resources.

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  When organizations use systems and/or services of external organizations, the auditing capability necessitates a coordinated approach across organizations. For example, maintaining the identity of individuals that requested specific services across organizational boundaries may often be very difficult, and doing so may prove to have significant performance and privacy ramifications. Therefore, it is often the case that cross-organizational auditing simply captures the identity of individuals issuing requests at the initial system, and subsequent systems record that the requests emanated from authorized individuals. </P>

The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and procedures. Comprehensive policy and procedures help provide security and privacy assurance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. The procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. It is important to recognize that restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations assess security and privacy controls in organizational systems and the environments in which those systems operate as part of initial and ongoing authorizations; FISMA annual assessments; continuous monitoring; and system development life cycle activities. Assessments ensure that organizations meet information security and privacy requirements; identify weaknesses and deficiencies in the development process; provide essential information needed to make risk-based decisions as part of authorization processes; and ensure compliance to vulnerability mitigation procedures. Organizations conduct assessments on the implemented controls from Chapter Three as documented in security plans and privacy plans. Organizations can use other types of assessment activities such as vulnerability scanning and system monitoring to maintain the security and privacy posture of systems during the entire life cycle. Assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by organizations, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting requirements. Assessment results are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted. For example, assessments conducted in support of authorization decisions are provided to authorizing officials, senior agency officials for privacy, and/or authorizing official designated representatives. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">To satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment results from the following sources: initial or ongoing system authorizations; continuous monitoring; or system development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that assessment results are current, relevant to the determination of control effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Existing control assessment results can be reused to the extent that the results are still valid and can also be supplemented with additional assessments as needed. After the initial authorizations, organizations assess controls during continuous monitoring. Organizations also establish the frequency for ongoing assessments in accordance with organizational continuous monitoring strategies. External audits including, for example, audits by external entities such as regulatory agencies, are outside the scope of this control. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Employ independent assessors or assessment teams to conduct security and privacy control assessments. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Independent assessors or assessment teams are individuals or groups conducting impartial assessments of systems. Impartiality implies that assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest regarding development, operation, sustainment, or management of the systems under assessment or the determination of control effectiveness. To achieve impartiality, assessors should not create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted; assess their own work; act as management or employees of the organizations they are serving; or place themselves in positions of advocacy for the organizations acquiring their services. Independent assessments can be obtained from elements within organizations or can be contracted to public or private sector entities outside of organizations. Authorizing officials determine the required level of independence based on the security categories of systems and/or the risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. Authorizing officials also determine if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient assurance that the results are sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based decisions. This includes determining whether contracted assessment services have sufficient independence, for example, when system owners are not directly involved in contracting processes or cannot influence the impartiality of assessors conducting assessments. When organizations that own the systems are small or organizational structures require that assessments are conducted by individuals that are in the developmental, operational, or management chain of system owners, independence in assessment processes can be achieved by ensuring that assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by independent teams of experts to validate the completeness, accuracy, integrity, and reliability of the results. Organizations recognize that assessments performed for purposes other than direct support to authorization decisions are, when performed by assessors with sufficient independence, more likely to be useable for such decisions, thereby reducing the need to repeat assessments. </P>

Authorizing officials provide budgetary oversight for organizational systems or assume responsibility for the mission and business operations supported by those systems. The authorization process is a federal responsibility and therefore, authorizing officials must be federal employees. Authorizing officials are responsible and accountable for security and privacy risks associated with the operation and use of organizational systems. Nonfederal organizations may have similar processes to authorize their systems and senior officials that assume the authorization role and associated responsibilities. Organizations conduct ongoing authorizations of systems by implementing continuous monitoring programs. Robust continuous monitoring programs reduce the need for separate reauthorization processes. Through the employment of comprehensive continuous monitoring processes, critical information contained in authorization packages including the security and privacy plans, security and privacy assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones, is updated on an ongoing basis. This provides authorizing officials, system owners, and common control providers with an up-to-date status of the security and privacy state of their systems, controls, and environments of operation. To reduce the cost of reauthorization, authorizing officials use the results of continuous monitoring processes to the maximum extent possible as the basis for rendering reauthorization decisions. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Continuous monitoring programs facilitate ongoing awareness of threats, vulnerabilities, and information security and privacy to support organizational risk management decisions. The terms continuous and ongoing imply that organizations assess security and privacy controls and associated risks at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions. The results of continuous monitoring generate risk response actions by organizations. When monitoring the effectiveness of controls that have been grouped into capabilities, a root-cause analysis may be needed to determine the specific control that has failed. Continuous monitoring programs also allow organizations to maintain the authorizations of systems and common controls over time in highly dynamic environments of operation with changing mission and business needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and technologies. Having access to security- and privacy-related information on a continuing basis through reports and dashboards gives organizational officials the capability to make more effective and timely risk management decisions, including ongoing authorization decisions. Automation supports more frequent updates to hardware, software, and firmware inventories, authorization packages, and other system information. Effectiveness is further enhanced when continuous monitoring outputs are formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and timely. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in accordance with the security categories of systems. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US"> Control:  Conduct penetration testing [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] on [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components]. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Penetration testing is a specialized type of assessment conducted on systems or individual system components to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries. Penetration testing goes beyond automated vulnerability scanning and is most effectively conducted by penetration testing agents and teams with demonstrable skills and experience that, depending on the scope of the penetration testing, include technical expertise in network, operating system, and/or application level security. Penetration testing can be used to either validate vulnerabilities or determine the degree of penetration resistance of systems to adversaries within specified constraints. Such constraints include, for example, time, resources, and skills. Penetration testing attempts to duplicate the actions of adversaries in carrying out attacks against organizations and provides a more in-depth analysis of security- and privacy-related weaknesses or deficiencies. Organizations can use the results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration testing activities. Penetration testing can be conducted on the hardware, software, or firmware components of a system and can exercise both physical and technical controls. A standard method for penetration testing includes, for example, pretest analysis based on full knowledge of the target system; pretest identification of potential vulnerabilities based on pretest analysis; and testing designed to determine exploitability of identified vulnerabilities. All parties agree to the rules of engagement before commencement of penetration testing scenarios. Organizations correlate the rules of engagement for the penetration tests with the tools, techniques, and procedures that are anticipated to be employed by adversaries carrying out attacks. Risk assessments guide the decisions on the level of independence required for personnel conducting penetration testing. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Red team exercises extend the objectives of penetration testing by examining the security and privacy posture of organizations and their ability to implement effective cyber defenses. Red team exercises reflect simulated attempts by adversaries to compromise organizational missions and business functions and provide a comprehensive assessment of the security and privacy state of systems and organizations. Simulated attempts by adversaries to compromise missions and business functions and the systems that support those missions and functions may include technology-based attacks and social engineering-based attacks. Technology-based attacks include interactions with hardware, software, or firmware components and/or mission and business processes. Social engineering-based attacks include interactions via email, telephone, shoulder surfing, or personal conversations. Red team exercises are most effectively conducted by penetration testing agents and teams with knowledge of and experience with current adversarial tactics, techniques, procedures, and tools. While penetration testing may be primarily laboratory-based testing, organizations can use red team exercises to provide more comprehensive assessments that reflect real-world conditions. Red team exercises can be used to improve security and privacy awareness and training and to assess control effectiveness. </P>

The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and procedures. Comprehensive policy and procedures help provide security and privacy assurance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. The procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. It is important to recognize that restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Configuration settings are the parameters that can be changed in hardware, software, or firmware components of the system that affect the security posture or functionality of the system. Information technology products for which security-related configuration settings can be defined include, for example, mainframe computers, servers, workstations, input/output devices, network devices, operating systems, and applications. Security-related parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of systems including the parameters required to satisfy other security control requirements. Security-related parameters include, for example, registry settings; account, file, directory permission settings; and settings for functions, ports, protocols, and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide configuration settings and subsequently derive specific configuration settings for systems. The established settings become part of the systems configuration baseline. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown and hardening guides, security reference guides, security technical implementation guides) provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for specific information technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring those system components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety of organizations including, for example, information technology product developers, manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and other organizations in the public and private sectors. Implementation of a specific common secure configuration may be mandated at the organizational or mission/business process level or may be mandated at a higher level including, for example, by a regulatory agency. Common secure configurations include the United States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB) which affects the implementation of CM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7.

Organizations review functions and services provided by systems or components of systems, to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination. Organizations consider disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, transfer of information, and tunneling. Organizations employ network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protection technologies such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, protocols, ports, and services. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Configuration management plans satisfy the requirements in configuration management policies while being tailored to individual systems. Such plans define processes and procedures for how configuration management is used to support system development life cycle activities. Configuration management plans are typically developed during the development and acquisition phase of the system development life cycle. The plans describe how to move changes through change management processes, how to update configuration settings and baselines, how to maintain system component inventories, how to control development, test, and operational environments, and how to develop, release, and update key documents. Organizations can employ templates to help ensure consistent and timely development and implementation of configuration management plans. Such templates can represent a master configuration management plan for the organization with subsets of the plan implemented on a system by system basis. Configuration management approval processes include designation of key management stakeholders responsible for reviewing and approving proposed changes to systems, and personnel that conduct security impact analyses prior to the implementation of changes to the systems. Configuration items are the system components (i.e., hardware, software, firmware, and documentation) to be configuration-managed. As systems continue through the system development life cycle, new configuration items may be identified and some existing configuration items may no longer need to be under configuration control. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Contingency planning for systems is part of an overall organizational program for achieving continuity of operations for mission/business functions. Contingency planning addresses system restoration and implementation of alternative mission or business processes when systems are compromised or breached. The effectiveness of contingency planning is maximized by considering such planning throughout the system development life cycle. Performing contingency planning on hardware, software, and firmware development can be an effective means of achieving system resiliency. Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational systems since not all systems need to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired. System recovery objectives reflect applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, regulations, and guidelines. In addition to availability, contingency plans address other security-related events resulting in a reduction in mission or business effectiveness, such as malicious attacks compromising the confidentiality or integrity of systems. Actions addressed in contingency plans include, for example, orderly and graceful degradation, system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for when systems are under attack. By coordinating contingency planning with incident handling activities, organizations can ensure that the necessary planning activities are in place and activated in the event of a security incident. </P>

To ensure mission and business continuity, organizations can implement alternative or supplemental security mechanisms. These mechanisms may be less effective than the primary mechanisms. However, having the capability to readily employ these alternative or supplemental mechanisms, enhances mission and business continuity that might otherwise be adversely impacted if operations had to be curtailed until the primary means of implementing the functions was restored. Given the cost and level of effort required to provide such alternative capabilities, this control is typically applied only to critical security capabilities provided by systems, system components, or system services.

Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents.

<P xml:lang="EN-US"> Control:  Uniquely identify and authenticate organizational users or processes acting on behalf of organizational users. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations can satisfy the identification and authentication requirements in this control by complying with the requirements in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12. Organizational users include employees or individuals that organizations consider having the equivalent status of employees including, for example, contractors and guest researchers. This control applies to all accesses other than accesses that are explicitly identified in AC-14 and that occur through the authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts or for detailed accountability of individual activity. Organizations employ passwords, physical authenticators, or biometrics to authenticate user identities, or in the case of multifactor authentication, some combination thereof. Access to organizational systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any access to organizational systems by users or processes acting on behalf of users, where such access is obtained through direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to organizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is obtained through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access that involves communication through external networks. Internal networks include local area networks and wide area networks. The use of encrypted virtual private networks for network connections between organization-controlled endpoints and non-organization controlled endpoints may be treated as internal networks with respect to protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information traversing the network. Identification and authentication requirements for non-organizational users are described in IA-8. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Examples of individual authenticators include passwords, cryptographic devices, one-time password devices, and key cards. The initial authenticator content is the actual content of the authenticator, for example, the initial password. In contrast, the requirements about authenticator content include, for example, the minimum password length. Developers may ship system components with factory default authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, and present a significant security risk. The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be implemented via control PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of individuals and by controls AC-3, AC-6, and SC-28 for authenticators stored in organizational systems including, for example, passwords stored in hashed or encrypted formats or files containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible with administrator privileges. Systems support authenticator management by organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics including, for example, minimum password length, validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric authentication. Actions that can be taken to safeguard individual authenticators include, for example, maintaining possession of authenticators, not loaning or sharing authenticators with others, and reporting lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators immediately. Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators for temporary access such as that required for remote maintenance. Device authenticators include, for example, certificates and passwords. </P>

</L>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Bind identities and authenticators dynamically. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Authentication requires some form of binding between an identity and the authenticator used to confirm the identity. In conventional approaches, this binding is established by pre-provisioning both the identity and the authenticator to the system. For example, the binding between a username (i.e., identity) and a password (i.e., authenticator) is accomplished by provisioning the identity and authenticator as a pair in the system. New authentication techniques allow the binding between the identity and the authenticator to be implemented outside a system. For example, with smartcard credentials, the identity and the authenticator are bound together on the smartcard. Using these credentials, systems can authenticate identities that have not been pre-provisioned, dynamically provisioning the identity after authentication. In these situations, organizations can anticipate the dynamic provisioning of identities. Pre-established trust relationships and mechanisms with appropriate authorities to validate identities and related credentials are essential. </P>

To address this threat, organizations may employ specific techniques or mechanisms and establish protocols to assess suspicious behavior. Such behavior may include, for example, accessing information that individuals do not typically access as part of their duties, roles, or responsibilities; accessing greater quantities of information than the individuals would routinely access; or attempting to access information from suspicious network addresses. In situations when pre-established conditions or triggers occur, organizations can require individuals to provide additional authentication information. Another potential use for adaptive authentication is to increase the strength of mechanism based on the number and/or types of records being accessed. Adaptive authentication does not replace and is not used to avoid multifactor mechanisms, but can augment implementations of these controls. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Having an integrated team for incident response facilitates information sharing. Such capability allows organizational personnel, including developers, implementers, and operators, to leverage the team knowledge of the threat to implement defensive measures that will enable organizations to deter intrusions more effectively. Moreover, integrated teams promote the rapid detection of intrusions, development of appropriate mitigations, and the deployment of effective defensive measures. For example, when an intrusion is detected, the integrated analysis team can rapidly develop an appropriate response for operators to implement, correlate the new incident with information on past intrusions, and augment ongoing intelligence development. This enables the team to identify adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures that are linked to the operations tempo or to specific missions and business functions, and to define responsive actions in a way that does not disrupt those missions and business functions. Information security analysis teams are distributed within organizations to make the capability more resilient. </P>

The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and procedures. Comprehensive policy and procedures help provide security and privacy assurance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. The procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. It is important to recognize that restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure. </P>

Such maintenance provides for the systematic inspection, tests, measurements, adjustments, parts replacement, detection, and correction of incipient failures either before they occur or before they develop into major defects. The primary goal of preventive maintenance is to avoid/mitigate the consequences of equipment failures. Preventive maintenance is designed to preserve and restore equipment reliability by replacing worn components before they fail. Methods of determining what preventive (or other) failure management policies to apply include, for example, original equipment manufacturer recommendations, statistical failure records, requirements of codes, legislation, or regulations within a jurisdiction, expert opinion, maintenance that has already been conducted on similar equipment, or measured values and performance indications. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Predictive maintenance, or condition-based maintenance, attempts to evaluate the condition of equipment by performing periodic or continuous (online) equipment condition monitoring. The goal of predictive maintenance is to perform maintenance at a scheduled point in time when the maintenance activity is most cost-effective and before the equipment loses performance within a threshold. The predictive component of predictive maintenance stems from the goal of predicting the future trend of the equipment's condition. This approach uses principles of statistical process control to determine at what point in the future maintenance activities will be appropriate. Most predictive maintenance inspections are performed while equipment is in service, thereby minimizing disruption of normal system operations. Predictive maintenance can result in substantial cost savings and higher system reliability. Predictive maintenance tends to include measurement of the item. To evaluate equipment condition, predictive maintenance utilizes nondestructive testing technologies such as infrared, acoustic (partial discharge and airborne ultrasonic), corona detection, vibration analysis, sound level measurements, oil analysis, and other specific online tests. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:   This control applies to all system media, both digital and non-digital, subject to disposal or reuse, whether or not the media is considered removable. Examples include: digital media found in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, network components, mobile devices; and non-digital media such as paper and microfilm. The sanitization process removes information from the media such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques, including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, and destruction, prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or released for disposal. Organizations determine the appropriate sanitization methods recognizing that destruction is sometimes necessary when other methods cannot be applied to media requiring sanitization. Organizations use discretion on the employment of approved sanitization techniques and procedures for media containing information deemed to be in the public domain or publicly releasable, or deemed to have no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released for reuse or disposal. Sanitization of non-digital media includes, for example, destruction, removing a classified appendix from an otherwise unclassified document, or redacting selected sections or words from a document by obscuring the redacted sections or words in a manner equivalent in effectiveness to removing them from the document. NARA policy and guidance control the sanitization process for controlled unclassified information. NSA standards and policies control the sanitization process for media containing classified information. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  System media includes digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. This control also applies to mobile devices with information storage capability. In contrast to MP-2, which restricts user access to media, this control restricts the use of certain types of media on systems, for example, restricting/prohibiting the use of flash drives or external hard disk drives. Organizations can employ technical and nontechnical safeguards to restrict the use of system media. Organizations may restrict the use of portable storage devices, for example, by using physical cages on workstations to prohibit access to certain external ports, or disabling or removing the ability to insert, read or write to such devices. Organizations may also limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices including, for example, devices provided by the organization, devices provided by other approved organizations, and devices that are not personally owned. Finally, organizations may restrict the use of portable storage devices based on the type of device, for example, prohibiting the use of writeable, portable storage devices, and implementing this restriction by disabling or removing the capability to write to such devices. Requiring identifiable owners for portable storage devices reduces the risk of using such devices by allowing organizations to assign responsibility for addressing known vulnerabilities in the devices. </P>

The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and procedures. Comprehensive policy and procedures help provide security and privacy assurance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. The procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. It is important to recognize that restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Security and privacy plans relate security and privacy requirements to a set of security and privacy controls and control enhancements. The plans describe how the security and privacy controls and control enhancements meet those security and privacy requirements, but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of the specific design or implementation of the controls and control enhancements. Security and privacy plans contain sufficient information (including the specification of parameter values for assignment and selection statements either explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation that is unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if the plan is implemented as intended. Organizations can also apply tailoring guidance to the control baselines in Appendix D to develop overlays for community-wide use or to address specialized requirements, technologies, missions, business applications, or environments of operation. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Security and privacy plans need not be single documents. The plans can be a collection of various documents including documents that already exist. Effective security and privacy plans make extensive use of references to policies, procedures, and additional documents including, for example, design and implementation specifications where more detailed information can be obtained. This reduces the documentation associated with security and privacy programs and maintains the security- and privacy-related information in other established management and operational areas including, for example, enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, systems engineering, and acquisition. Thus, security and privacy plans do not contain detailed contingency plan or incident response plan information but instead provide explicitly or by reference, sufficient information to define what needs to be accomplished by those plans. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  This control addresses actions taken by organizations in the design and development of systems. The security and privacy architectures at the system level are consistent with and complement the organization-wide security and privacy architectures described in PM-7 that are integral to and developed as part of the enterprise architecture. The security and privacy architectures include an architectural description, the placement and allocation of security and privacy functionality (including security and privacy controls), security- and privacy-related information for external interfaces, information being exchanged across the interfaces, and the protection mechanisms associated with each interface. In addition, the security and privacy architectures can include other information, for example, user roles and the access privileges assigned to each role, unique security and privacy requirements, types of information processed, stored, and transmitted by the system, restoration priorities of information and system services, and any other specific protection needs. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">In today's modern computing architectures, it is becoming less common for organizations to control all information resources. There may be key dependencies on external information services and service providers. Describing such dependencies in the security and privacy architectures is important to developing a comprehensive mission and business protection strategy. Establishing, developing, documenting, and maintaining under configuration control, a baseline configuration for organizational systems is critical to implementing and maintaining effective security and privacy architectures. The development of the security and privacy architectures is coordinated with the Senior Agency Information Security Officer and the Senior Agency Official for Privacy to ensure that security and privacy controls needed to support security and privacy requirements are identified and effectively implemented. PL-8 is primarily directed at organizations to ensure that they develop security and privacy architectures for the system, and that the architectures are integrated with or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture through the organization-wide security and privacy architectures. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily directed at external information technology product and system developers and integrators. SA-17, which is complementary to PL-8, is selected when organizations outsource the development of systems or system components to external entities, and there is a need to demonstrate consistency with the organization's enterprise architecture and security and privacy architectures. </P>

Requiring adversaries to defeat multiple mechanisms makes it more difficult to successfully attack critical information resources by increasing the work factor of the adversary. It also increases the likelihood of detection. The coordination of allocated safeguards is essential to ensure that an attack that involves one safeguard does not create adverse unintended consequences by interfering with other safeguards. Examples of such unintended consequences include system lockout and cascading alarms. Placement of security safeguards is an important activity requiring thoughtful analysis. The criticality or value of the organizational asset is a key consideration in providing additional layering.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Central management refers to the organization-wide management and implementation of selected security and privacy controls and related processes. This includes planning, implementing, assessing, authorizing, and monitoring the organization-defined, centrally managed controls and processes. As the central management of security and privacy controls is generally associated with the concept of common controls, such management promotes and facilitates standardization of control implementations and management and judicious use of organizational resources. Centrally-managed controls and processes may also meet independence requirements for assessments in support of initial and ongoing authorizations to operate and as part of organizational continuous monitoring. As part of the security and privacy control selection processes, organizations determine which controls may be suitable for central management based on organizational resources and capabilities. It is not always possible to centrally manage every aspect of a security or privacy control. In such cases, the control can be treated as a hybrid control with the control managed and implemented centrally or at the system level. Those controls and control enhancements that are candidates for full or partial central management include, but are not limited to: AC-2 (1) (2) (3) (4); AC-17 (1) (2) (3) (9); AC-18 (1) (3) (4) (5); AC-19 (4); AC-22; AC-23; AT-2 (1) (2); AT-3 (1) (2) (3); AT-4; AU-6 (1) (3) (5) (6) (9); AU-7 (1) (2); AU-11, AU-13, AU-16, CA-2 (1) (2) (3); CA-3 (1) (2) (3); CA-7 (1); CA-9; CM-2 (1) (2); CM-3 (1) (4); CM-4; CM-6 (1); CM-7 (4) (5); CM-8 (all); CM-9 (1); CM-10; CM-11; CP-7 (all); CP-8 (all); SC-43; SI-2; SI-3; SI-7; and SI-8. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  The selection of an appropriate control baseline is determined by the needs of organizational stakeholders. Stakeholder needs and concerns consider mission and business requirements and mandates imposed by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. For example, the three control baselines in Appendix D are based on the requirements from the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) and the Privacy Act. These requirements, along with the NIST standards and guidelines implementing the legislation, require organizations to select one of the control baselines after the reviewing the information types and the information that is processed, stored, and transmitted on organizational systems; analyzing the potential adverse impact or consequences of the loss or compromise of the system or information on the organization's operations and assets, individuals, other organizations or the Nation; and considering the results from organizational and system assessments of risk. Nonfederal organizations that are part of other communities of interest including the U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, can develop similar control baselines (using the controls in Chapter Three) that represent the needs and concerns of those entities.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US"> Control:  Tailor the selected control baseline by applying specified tailoring actions.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  The concept of tailoring allows organizations to specialize or customize a set of baseline controls by applying a defined set of tailoring actions. These actions facilitate such specialization and customization by allowing organizations to develop security and privacy plans that reflect their specific missions and business functions, the environments where their systems operate, the threats and vulnerabilities that can affect their systems, and any other conditions or situations that can impact their mission or business success. The tailoring actions are described in Appendix G. Tailoring a control baseline is accomplished by identifying and designating common controls; applying scoping considerations; selecting compensating controls; assigning values to control parameters; supplementing the control baseline with additional controls, as needed; and providing information for control implementation. The general tailoring actions in Appendix G can be supplemented with additional actions based on the needs of organizations. Tailoring actions can be applied to the baselines in Appendix D in accordance with the security requirements from the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) and the privacy requirements from the Privacy Act. Alternatively, other communities of interest adopting different control baselines can apply the tailoring actions in Appendix G to specialize or customize the controls that represent the specific needs and concerns of those entities. </P>

Security plans for individual systems and the organization-wide information security program plan, provide complete coverage for all security controls employed within the organization. Common controls are documented in an appendix to the organization's information security program plan unless the controls are included in a separate security plan for a system. The organization-wide information security program plan will indicate which separate security plans contain descriptions of common controls.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Protection needs are technology-independent, required capabilities to counter threats to organizations, individuals, systems, and the Nation through the compromise of information (i.e., loss of confidentiality, integrity, availability, or privacy). Information protection and personally identifiable information processing needs are derived from mission and business needs defined by the stakeholders in organizations, the mission and business processes defined to meet those needs, and the organizational risk management strategy. Information protection and personally identifiable information processing needs determine the required security and privacy controls for the organization and the systems supporting the mission and business processes. Inherent in defining the protection and personally identifiable information processing needs, is an understanding of adverse impact or consequences that could result if a compromise of information occurs. The categorization process is used to make such potential impact determinations. Privacy risks to individuals can arise from the compromise of personally identifiable information, but they can also arise as unintended consequences or a byproduct of authorized processing of information at any stage of the data life cycle. Privacy risk assessments are used to prioritize the risks that are created for individuals from system processing of personally identifiable information. These risk assessments enable the selection of the required privacy controls for the organization and systems supporting the mission and business processes. Mission and business process definitions and the associated protection requirements are documented in accordance with organizational policy and procedures. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US"> Control:  Implement an insider threat program that includes a cross-discipline insider threat incident handling team. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations handling classified information are required, under Executive Order 13587 and the National Policy on Insider Threat, to establish insider threat programs. The standards and guidelines that apply to insider threat programs in classified environments can also be employed effectively to improve the security of Controlled Unclassified Information in non-national security systems. Insider threat programs include controls to detect and prevent malicious insider activity through the centralized integration and analysis of both technical and non-technical information to identify potential insider threat concerns. A senior official is designated by the department or agency head as the responsible individual to implement and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized integration and analysis capability, insider threat programs as a minimum, prepare department or agency insider threat policies and implementation plans; conduct host-based user monitoring of individual employee activities on government-owned classified computers; provide insider threat awareness training to employees; receive access to information from all offices within the department or agency for insider threat analysis; and conduct self-assessments of department or agency insider threat posture. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Insider threat programs can leverage the existence of incident handling teams that organizations may already have in place, such as computer security incident response teams. Human resources records are especially important in this effort, as there is compelling evidence to show that some types of insider crimes are often preceded by nontechnical behaviors in the workplace including, for example, ongoing patterns of disgruntled behavior and conflicts with coworkers and other colleagues. These precursors can better inform and guide organizational officials in more focused, targeted monitoring efforts. However, the use of human resource records could raise significant concerns for privacy. The participation of a comprehensive legal team, including consultation with the senior agency officer for privacy (SAOP), ensures that all monitoring activities are performed in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. </P>

This can include sharing threat events (i.e., tactics, techniques, and procedures) that organizations have experienced, mitigations that organizations have found are effective against certain types of threats, and threat intelligence (i.e., indications and warnings about threats that can occur). Threat information sharing may be bilateral or multilateral. Examples of bilateral threat sharing include government-commercial cooperatives and government-government cooperatives. An example of multilateral sharing includes organizations taking part in threat-sharing consortia. Threat information may be highly sensitive requiring special agreements and protection, or less sensitive and freely shared. </P>

The measures taken to protect data quality are based on the nature and context of the personally identifiable information, how it is to be used, how it was obtained, the impact level of the personally identifiable information obtained, and potential de-identification methods employed. Measures taken to validate the accuracy of personally identifiable information that is used to make determinations about the rights, benefits, or privileges of individuals under federal programs may be more comprehensive than those used to validate less sensitive personally identifiable information. Additional steps may be necessary to validate personally identifiable information that is obtained from sources other than individuals or the authorized representatives of individuals.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  As data is obtained and used across the information life cycle, it is important to confirm the accuracy and relevance of personally identifiable information.  Automated tools and techniques can augment existing process and procedures and enable an organization to better identify and manage personally identifiable information in large-scale systems. For example, automated tools can greatly improve efforts to consistently normalize data or identify malformed data. Automated tools can also be used to improve auditing of data, to track how data is used across the information life cycle, and to detect errors that may incorrectly alter personally identifiable information or incorrectly associate such information with the wrong individual. These automated capabilities backstop processes and procedures at-scale. They also enable more fine-grained detection and correction of data quality errors. </P>

Security topics of interest at exit interviews can include, for example, reminding terminated individuals of nondisclosure agreements and potential limitations on future employment. Exit interviews may not be possible for some terminated individuals, for example, in cases related to job abandonment, illnesses, and unavailability of supervisors. Exit interviews are important for individuals with security clearances. Timely execution of termination actions is essential for individuals terminated for cause. In certain situations, organizations consider disabling the system accounts of individuals that are being terminated prior to the individuals being notified. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations apply the "high water mark" concept to each of their systems categorized in accordance with FIPS Publication 199. This process results in systems designated as low impact, moderate impact, or high impact. Organizations desiring additional granularity in the system impact designations for risk-based decision making, can further partition the systems into sub-categories of the initial, first-level system categorization. For example, a second-level categorization on a moderate-impact system can produce three new sub-categories: low-moderate systems, moderate-moderate systems, and high-moderate systems. This secondary categorization and the resulting sub-categories of the system give organizations an opportunity to further prioritize their investments related to security control selection and the tailoring of control baselines in responding to identified risks. Second-level categorization can also be used to determine those systems that are exceptionally critical to organizational missions and business operations. These systems are sometimes described as high-value assets and thus, organizations may be more focused on complexity, aggregation, and interconnections. Such systems can be identified by partitioning high-impact systems into low-high systems, moderate-high systems, and high-high systems. </P>

Vulnerability analyses for custom software may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can use these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a variety of tools including, for example, web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, and binary analyzers. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example, scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. Scanning tools that facilitate interoperability include, for example, products that are Security Content Automated Protocol (SCAP) validated. Thus, organizations consider using scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of vulnerabilities. Sources for vulnerability information include, for example, the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Control assessments such as red team exercises provide additional sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using scanning tools that express vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Control:  Identify critical system components and functions by performing a criticality analysis for [Assignment: organization-defined systems, system components, or system services] at [Assignment: organization-defined decision points in the system development life cycle]. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Not all system components, functions, or services necessarily require significant protections. Criticality analysis is a key tenet of, for example, supply chain risk management, and informs the prioritization of protection activities. The identification of critical system components and functions considers applicable regulations, directives, policies, standards, and guidelines, system functionality requirements, system and component interfaces, and system and component dependencies. Systems engineers conduct an end-to-end functional decomposition of a system to identify mission-critical functions and components. The functional decomposition includes the identification of core organizational missions supported by the system, decomposition into the specific functions to perform those missions, and traceability to the hardware, software, and firmware components that implement those functions, including when the functions are shared by many components within and beyond the system boundary. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">The operational environment of a system or component may impact the criticality including, for example, the connections to and dependencies on cyber-physical systems, devices, system-of-systems, and outsourced IT services. System components that allow unmediated access to critical system components or functions are considered critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities such components create. Component and function criticality are assessed in terms of the impact of a component or function failure on the organizational missions supported by the system containing those components and functions. A criticality analysis is performed when an architecture or design is being developed, modified, or upgraded. If done early in the system life cycle, organizations may consider modifying the system design to reduce the critical nature of these components and functions by, for example, adding redundancy or alternate paths into the system design. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  A system development life cycle process provides the foundation for the successful development, implementation, and operation of organizational systems. To apply the required security and privacy controls within the system development life cycle requires a basic understanding of information security and privacy, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical missions and business functions. The security engineering principles in SA-8 help individuals properly design, code, and test systems and system components. Organizations include qualified personnel including, for example, chief information security officers, security architects, security engineers, system security officers, and chief privacy officers in system development life cycle processes to ensure that established security and privacy requirements are incorporated into organizational systems. It is also important that developers include individuals on the development team that possess the requisite security and privacy expertise and skills to ensure that the needed security and privacy capabilities are effectively integrated into the system. Role-based security and privacy training programs can ensure that individuals having key security and privacy roles and responsibilities have the experience, skills, and expertise to conduct assigned system development life cycle activities. The effective integration of security and privacy requirements into enterprise architecture also ensures that important security and privacy considerations are addressed early in the system life cycle and that those considerations are directly related to organizational mission and business processes. This process also facilitates the integration of the information security and privacy architectures into the enterprise architecture, consistent with risk management strategy of the organization. Because the development life cycle of a system involves multiple organizations, including, for example, external suppliers, developers, integrators, and service providers, it is important to recognize that acquisition and supply chain risk management functions and controls play a significant role in the overall effective management of the system during that life cycle. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations can apply systems security and privacy engineering principles to new systems under development or to systems undergoing upgrades. For legacy systems, organizations apply systems security and privacy engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given the current state of hardware, software, and firmware components within those systems. The application of systems security and privacy engineering concepts and principles help to develop trustworthy, secure systems and system components and reduce the susceptibility of organizations to disruptions, hazards, threats, and creating privacy-related problems for individuals. Examples of these concepts and principles include, developing layered protections; establishing security and privacy policies, architecture, and controls as the foundation for design and development; incorporating security and privacy requirements into the system development life cycle; delineating physical and logical security boundaries; ensuring that developers are trained on how to build secure software; tailoring security and privacy controls to meet organizational and operational needs; performing threat modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors and patterns, design patterns, and compensating controls needed to mitigate risk. Organizations that apply security and privacy engineering concepts and principles can facilitate the development of trustworthy, secure systems, system components, and system services; reduce risk to acceptable levels; and make informed risk management decisions. Security engineering principles can also be used to protect against certain supply chain risks including, for example, incorporating tamper-resistant hardware into a design. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  External system services are those services that are implemented external to authorization boundaries of organizational systems. This includes services that are used by, but not a part of, organizational systems. Organizations establish relationships with external service providers in a variety of ways including, for example, through business partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, joint ventures, and supply chain exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external system services remains with authorizing officials. For services external to organizations, a chain of trust requires that organizations establish and retain a level of confidence that each provider in the consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered. The extent and nature of this chain of trust varies based on the relationships between organizations and the external providers. Organizations document the basis for trust relationships so the relationships can be monitored over time. External system services documentation includes government, service providers, end user security roles and responsibilities, and service-level agreements. Service-level agreements define expectations of performance for implemented security and privacy controls; describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements for identified instances of noncompliance. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  The degree of confidence that the risk from using external services is at an acceptable level depends on the trust that organizations place in the external providers, individually or in combination. Trust relationships can help organizations to gain increased levels of confidence that participating service providers are providing adequate protection for the services rendered. They can also be useful when conducting incident response or when planning for upgrades or obsolescence. Trust relationships can be complicated due to the number of potential entities participating in the consumer-provider interactions, subordinate relationships and levels of trust, and types of interactions between the parties. In some cases, the degree of trust is based on the level of control organizations can exert on external service providers regarding the controls necessary for the protection of the service, information, or individual privacy and the evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of the implemented controls. The level of control is established by the terms and conditions of the contracts or service-level agreements. Extensive control may include negotiating contracts or agreements that specify security and privacy requirements for providers.

This occurs when external providers control the location of processing, storage, or services. The criteria that external providers use for the selection of processing, storage, or service locations may be different from the criteria organizations use. For example, organizations may desire that data or information storage locations are restricted to certain locations to help facilitate incident response activities in case of information security or privacy incidents. Such incident response activities including, for example, forensic analyses and after-the-fact investigations, may be adversely affected by the governing laws or protocols in the locations where processing and storage occur and/or the locations from which system services emanate. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Developmental testing and evaluation confirms that the required security and privacy controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, enforcing the desired security and privacy policies, and meeting established security and privacy requirements. Security properties of systems and the privacy of individuals may be affected by the interconnection of system components or changes to those components. These interconnections or changes including, for example, upgrading or replacing applications, operating systems, and firmware, may adversely affect previously implemented security and privacy controls. This control provides additional types of testing and evaluation that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate potential flaws. Testing custom software applications may require approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Developers can use these analysis approaches in a variety of tools and in source code reviews. Security and privacy assessment plans provide the specific activities that developers plan to carry out including the types of analyses, testing, evaluation, and reviews of software and firmware components, the degree of rigor to be applied, and the types of artifacts produced during those processes. The depth of testing and evaluation refers to the rigor and level of detail associated with the assessment process. The coverage of testing and evaluation refers to the scope (i.e., number and type) of the artifacts included in the assessment process.

Such analysis can be used to identify vulnerabilities and enforce secure coding practices. Static code analysis is most effective when used early in the development process, when each code change can be automatically scanned for potential weaknesses. Static analysis can provide clear remediation guidance along with defects to enable developers to fix such defects. Evidence of correct implementation of static analysis can include, for example, aggregate defect density for critical defect types; evidence that defects were inspected by developers or security professionals; and evidence that defects were remediated. An excessively high density of ignored findings, commonly referred to as false positives, indicates a potential problem with the analysis process or the analysis tool. In such cases, organizations weigh the validity of the evidence against evidence from other sources. </P>

Fuzz testing strategies derive from the intended use of applications and the associated functional and design specifications for the applications. To understand the scope of dynamic code analysis and hence the assurance provided, organizations may also consider conducting code coverage analysis (checking the degree to which the code has been tested using metrics such as percent of subroutines tested or percent of program statements called during execution of the test suite) and/or concordance analysis (checking for words that are out of place in software code such as non-English language words or derogatory terms). </P>

Such events can also adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Supply chain-related events may be unintentional or malicious and occur at any point during the system life cycle. Managing supply chain risks involves gaining visibility and understanding of the processes and procedures used to protect the system, system component, or system service throughout the system life cycle. This allows organizations to make appropriate acquisition decisions and to identify appropriate mitigation strategies. A supply chain risk management plan includes, for example, an unambiguous expression of the supply chain risk tolerance for the system, acceptable supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls, a description of and justification for supply chain protection measures taken, a process for consistently evaluating and monitoring supply chain risk, approaches for implementing and communicating the supply chain risk management plan, and associated roles and responsibilities. </P>

There are many useful tools and techniques available including, for example, obscuring the end use of a system or system component, using blind or filtered buys, requiring tamper-evident packaging, or using trusted or controlled distribution. The results from a supply chain risk assessment can inform which strategies, tools, and methods are most applicable to the situation. Tools and techniques may provide protections against the insertion of counterfeits, tampering, theft, unauthorized production, insertion of malicious software, as well as poor manufacturing and development practices throughout the system development life cycle. Organizations also consider creating incentives for suppliers who implement security and privacy controls; promote transparency into their organizational processes and security and privacy practices; provide additional vetting of the processes and practices of subordinate suppliers, critical system components, and services; restrict purchases from specific suppliers; and provide contract language that addresses the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit components.

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Knowing who and what is in the supply chains of organizations is critical to gaining visibility into what is happening within such supply chains. It is also important for monitoring and identifying high-risk events and activities. Without reasonable visibility and traceability into supply chains (i.e., elements, processes, and personnel), it is very difficult for organizations to understand, and therefore manage risk, and ultimately reduce the likelihood of or susceptibility to adverse events. Supply chain elements are systems or system components that contain programmable logic and that are critically important to system functions. Supply chain processes include, for example, hardware, software, and firmware development processes; shipping and handling procedures; personnel and physical security programs; configuration management tools, techniques, and measures to maintain provenance; or other programs, processes, or procedures associated with the production and distribution of supply chain elements. Supply chain personnel are individuals in the supply chain with specific roles and responsibilities related to, for example, the secure development, delivery, maintenance, and disposal of a system or system component. Tracking the unique identifiers of supply chain elements, processes, and personnel establishes a foundational identity structure for assessment of supply chain activities and for the establishment and maintenance of provenance. For example, supply chain elements may be labeled using serial numbers or tagged using radio-frequency identification tags. These labels and tags can help provide the organization better visibility into the provenance of that element. Identification methods are sufficient to support a forensic investigation in the event of a supply chain compromise or event. </P>

Organizations consider developing procedures for allocating responsibilities for the creation, maintenance, and monitoring of provenance for systems and components; transferring provenance documentation and responsibility between organizations; and preventing and monitoring for unauthorized changes to the provenance records. Organizations consider developing methods to document, monitor, and maintain valid provenance baselines for systems, system components, and related data. Such actions help track, assess, and document changes to the provenance, including changes in supply chain elements or configuration, and ensure non-repudiation of provenance information and the provenance change records. </P>

The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and procedures. Comprehensive policy and procedures help provide security and privacy assurance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. The procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and plans or in one or more separate documents. It is important to recognize that restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  The system isolates security functions from nonsecurity functions by means of an isolation boundary implemented via partitions and domains. Such isolation controls access to and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and firmware that perform those security functions. Systems implement code separation in many ways, for example, through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For non-kernel code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that protect the code on disk and address space protections that protect executing code. Systems can restrict access to security functions using access control mechanisms and by implementing least privilege capabilities. While the ideal is for all code within the defined security function isolation boundary to only contain security-relevant code, it is sometimes necessary to include nonsecurity functions within the isolation boundary as an exception. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  In those instances where it is not feasible to achieve strict isolation of nonsecurity functions from security functions, it is necessary to take actions to minimize the nonsecurity-relevant functions within the security function boundary. Nonsecurity functions contained within the isolation boundary are considered security-relevant because errors or the maliciousness in such software, can directly impact the security functions of systems. The fundamental design objective is that the specific portions of systems providing information security are of minimal size and complexity. Minimizing the number of nonsecurity functions in the security-relevant system components allows designers and implementers to focus only on those functions which are necessary to provide the desired security capability (typically access enforcement). By minimizing nonsecurity functions within the isolation boundaries, the amount of code that must be trusted to enforce security policies is significantly reduced, thus contributing to understandability. </P>

This control enhancement is implemented within the system by the detection of split tunneling (or of configuration settings that allow split tunneling) in the remote device, and by prohibiting the connection if the remote device is using split tunneling. Split tunneling might be desirable by remote users to communicate with local system resources such as printers or file servers. However, split tunneling can allow unauthorized external connections, making the system more vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of organizational information. The use of VPNs for remote connections, when adequately provisioned with the appropriate security controls, may provide the organization with sufficient assurance that it can effectively treat such connections as non-remote connections with respect to the objectives of confidentiality and integrity. VPNs provide a means for allowing non-remote communications paths from remote devices. The use of an adequately provisioned VPN does not eliminate the need for preventing split tunneling. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Trusted paths are mechanisms by which users (through input devices) can communicate directly with security functions of systems with the requisite assurance to support security policies. These mechanisms can be activated only by users or the security functions of organizational systems. User responses via trusted paths are protected from modifications by or disclosure to untrusted applications. Organizations employ trusted paths for trustworthy, high-assurance connections between security functions of systems and users including, for example, during system logons. The original implementations of trusted path used an out-of-band signal to initiate the path, for example using the &lt;BREAK&gt; key, which does not transmit characters that can be spoofed. In later implementations, a key combination that could not be hijacked was used, for example, the &lt;CTRL&gt; + &lt;ALT&gt; + &lt;DEL&gt; keys. Note, however, that any such key combinations are platform-specific and may not provide a trusted path implementation in every case. Enforcement of trusted communications paths is typically provided by a specific implementation that meets the reference monitor concept. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Cryptography can be employed to support a variety of security solutions including, for example, the protection of classified information and Controlled Unclassified Information; the provision and implementation of digital signatures; and the enforcement of information separation when authorized individuals have the necessary clearances but lack the necessary formal access approvals. Cryptography can also be used to support random number generation and hash generation. Generally applicable cryptographic standards include FIPS-validated cryptography and NSA-approved cryptography. This control does not impose any requirements on organizations to use cryptography. However, if cryptography is required due to the selection of other security controls, organizations define each type of cryptographic use and the type of cryptography required. For example, organizations that need to protect classified information specify the use of NSA-approved cryptography. Organizations that need to provision and implement digital signatures specify the use of FIPS-validated cryptography. In all instances, cryptography is implemented in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Systems that provide name and address resolution services include, for example, domain name system (DNS) servers. To eliminate single points of failure and to enhance redundancy, organizations employ at least two authoritative domain name system servers; one configured as the primary server and the other configured as the secondary server. Additionally, organizations typically deploy the servers in two geographically separated network subnetworks (i.e., not located in the same physical facility). For role separation, DNS servers with internal roles only process name and address resolution requests from within organizations (i.e., from internal clients).

System-related information requiring protection includes, for example, configurations or rule sets for firewalls, gateways, intrusion detection and prevention systems, filtering routers, and authenticator content. Organizations may employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, including the use of cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Integrity protection can be achieved, for example, by implementing Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) technologies.

For example, virtualization techniques provide organizations with the ability to disguise systems, potentially reducing the likelihood of successful attacks without the cost of having multiple platforms. Increased use of concealment and misdirection techniques and methods including, for example, randomness, uncertainty, and virtualization, may sufficiently confuse and mislead adversaries and subsequently increase the risk of discovery and/or exposing tradecraft. Concealment and misdirection techniques may also provide organizations additional time to successfully perform core missions and business functions. Because of the time and effort required to support concealment and misdirection techniques, it is anticipated that such techniques would be used by organizations on a very limited basis. </P>

Such actions may impede the ability of adversaries to correctly target information resources of organizations supporting critical missions or business functions.

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Adversaries target critical missions and business functions and the systems supporting those missions and functions while at the same time, trying to minimize exposure of their existence and tradecraft. The static, homogeneous, and deterministic nature of organizational systems targeted by adversaries, make such systems more susceptible to attacks with less adversary cost and effort to be successful. Changing processing and storage locations (sometimes referred to as moving target defense) addresses the advanced persistent threat (APT) using techniques such as virtualization, distributed processing, and replication. This enables organizations to relocate the system components (i.e., processing and/or storage) supporting critical missions and business functions. Changing the locations of processing activities and/or storage sites introduces a degree of uncertainty into the targeting activities by adversaries. This uncertainty increases the work factor of adversaries making compromises or breaches to organizational systems much more difficult and time-consuming. It also increases the chances that adversaries may inadvertently disclose aspects of tradecraft while attempting to locate critical organizational resources. </P>

The OPSEC process involves five steps: identification of critical information; analysis of threats; analysis of vulnerabilities; assessment of risks; and the application of appropriate countermeasures. OPSEC safeguards are applied to organizational systems and the environments in which those systems operate. OPSEC safeguards protect the confidentiality of key information including, for example, limiting the sharing of information with suppliers and potential suppliers of system components and services, and with other non-organizational elements and individuals. Information critical to organizational mission and business success includes, for example, user identities, element uses, suppliers, supply chain processes, functional and security requirements, system design specifications, testing and evaluation protocols, and security control implementation details. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">and mobile devices. Malicious code includes, for example, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be encoded in various formats contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using techniques such as steganography. Malicious code can be inserted into systems in a variety of ways including, for example, by electronic mail, the world-wide web, and portable storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of malicious code. Malicious code protection mechanisms include, for example, signature- and nonsignature-based technologies. Nonsignature-based detection mechanisms include, for example, artificial intelligence techniques that use heuristics to detect, analyze, and describe the characteristics or behavior of malicious code and to provide safeguards against such code for which signatures do not yet exist or for which existing signatures may not be effective. This includes polymorphic malicious code (i.e., code that changes signatures when it replicates). Nonsignature-based mechanisms also include reputation-based technologies. In addition to the above technologies, pervasive configuration management, comprehensive software integrity controls, and anti-exploitation software may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. Malicious code may be present in commercial off-the-shelf software and in custom-built software. This could include, for example, logic bombs, back doors, and other types of attacks that could affect organizational missions and business functions. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">In situations where malicious code cannot be detected by detection methods and technologies, organizations rely instead on other types of safeguards including, for example, secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions other than the functions intended. Organizations may determine that in response to the detection of malicious code, different actions may be warranted. For example, organizations can define actions in response to malicious code detection during periodic scans, actions in response to detection of malicious downloads, or actions in response to detection of maliciousness when attempting to open or execute files. Due to system integrity and availability concerns, organizations consider the specific methodology used to carry out automatic updates. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  System monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. External monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at system boundaries. Internal monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the system. Organizations monitor systems, for example, by observing audit activities in real time or by observing other system aspects such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives guide and inform the determination of the events. System monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques, including, for example, intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, and network monitoring software. The distribution and configuration of monitoring devices can impact throughput at key internal and external boundaries, and at other locations across a network due to the introduction of network throughput latency. Therefore, such devices are strategically located and deployed as part of an established organization-wide security architecture. Strategic locations for monitoring devices include, for example, selected perimeter locations and near key servers and server farms supporting critical applications. Monitoring devices are typically employed at the managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7 and AC-17. The information collected is a function of the organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of systems to support such objectives. Specific types of transactions of interest include, for example, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP proxies. System monitoring is an integral part of organizational continuous monitoring and incident response programs and output from system monitoring serves as input to those programs. Adjustments to levels of system monitoring are based on law enforcement information, intelligence information, or other credible sources of information. The legality of system monitoring activities is based on applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Control:  Check the validity of [Assignment: organization-defined information inputs]. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Checking the valid syntax and semantics of system inputs including, for example, character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values, verifies that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Software applications typically follow well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the corrupted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation ensures accurate and correct inputs and prevent attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks. </P>

For example, 802.11 standard wireless network protocols do not interact well with Transmission Control Protocols (TCP) when packets are dropped (which could be due to invalid packet input). TCP assumes packet losses are due to congestion, while packets lost over 802.11 links are typically dropped due to collisions or noise on the link. If TCP makes a congestion response, it takes the wrong action in response to a collision event. Adversaries may be able to use what appears to be acceptable individual behaviors of the protocols in concert to achieve adverse effects through suitable construction of invalid input. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  This control mitigates risk from advanced persistent threats (APTs) by significantly reducing the targeting capability of adversaries (i.e., window of opportunity and available attack surface) to initiate and complete attacks. By implementing the concept of non-persistence for selected system components, organizations can provide a known state computing resource for a specific time-period that does not give adversaries sufficient time on target to exploit vulnerabilities in organizational systems and the environments in which those systems operate. Since the APT is a high-end, sophisticated threat regarding capability, intent, and targeting, organizations assume that over an extended period, a percentage of attacks will be successful. Non-persistent system components and services are activated as required using protected information and terminated periodically or at the end of sessions. Non-persistence increases the work factor of adversaries in attempting to compromise or breach organizational systems. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Non-persistence can be achieved by refreshing system components, for example, by periodically re-imaging components or by using a variety of common virtualization techniques. Non-persistent services can be implemented using virtualization techniques as part of virtual machines or as new instances of processes on physical machines (either persistent or non-persistent). The benefit of periodic refreshes of system components and services is that it does not require organizations to first determine whether compromises of components or services have occurred (something that may often be difficult to determine). The refresh of selected system components and services occurs with sufficient frequency to prevent the spread or intended impact of attacks, but not with such frequency that it makes the system unstable. Refreshes of critical components and services may be done periodically to hinder the ability of adversaries to exploit optimum windows of vulnerabilities. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">De-identify the dataset upon collection by not collecting personally identifiable information. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  If a data source contains personally identifiable information but the information will not be used, the dataset can be de-identified upon creation by simply not collecting the data elements containing the personally identifiable information. For example, if an organization does not intend to use the social security number of an applicant, then application forms do not ask for a social security number. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Datasets can be archived for many reasons. The envisioned purposes for the archived dataset are specified and if personally identifiable information elements are not required, the elements are not archived. For example, social security numbers may have been collected for record linkage, but the archived dataset may include the required elements from the linked records. In this case, it is not necessary to archive the social security numbers.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Remove, mask, encrypt, hash, or replace direct identifiers in a dataset. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  There are many possible processes for removing direct identifiers from a dataset. Columns in a dataset that contain a direct identifier can be removed. In masking, the direct identifier is transformed into a repeating character, for example, XXXXXX or 999999.  Identifiers can be encrypted or hashed, so that the linked records remain linked. In the case of encryption or hashing, algorithms are employed that require the use of a key, including, for example, the Advanced Encryption Standard or a Hash-based Message Authentication Code. Implementations may use the same key for all identifiers or a different key for each identifier. Using a different key for each identifier provides for a higher degree of security and privacy. Identifiers can alternatively be replaced with a keyword, including for example, transforming "George Washington" to "PATIENT," or replaced with a realistic surrogate value, including for example, transforming "George Washington" to "Abraham Polk." </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Many types of statistical analyses can result in the disclosure of information about individuals even if only summary information is provided. For example, if a school publishes a monthly table with the number of minority students, and in January the school reports that it has 10-19 such students, but in March it reports that it has 20-29 such students, then it can be inferred that the student who enrolled in February was a minority. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Prevent disclosure of personally identifiable information by adding non-deterministic noise to the results of mathematical operations before the results are reported. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  The mathematical definition for differential privacy holds that the result of a dataset analysis should be approximately the same before and after the addition or removal of a single data record (which is assumed to be the data from a single individual). In its most basic form, differential privacy applies only to online query systems. However, it can also be used to produce machine-learning statistical classifiers and synthetic data. Differential privacy comes at the cost of decreased accuracy of results, forcing organizations to quantify the trade-off between privacy protection and the overall accuracy, usefulness, and utility of the de-identified dataset. Non-deterministic noise can include, for example, adding small random values to the results of mathematical operations in dataset analysis. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  Algorithms that appear to remove personally identifiable information from a dataset may in fact leave information that is personally identifiable or data that are re-identifiable. Software that is claimed to implement a validated algorithm may contain bugs or may implement a different algorithm. Software may de-identify one type of data, for example, integers, but not another type of data, for example, floating point numbers. For these reasons, de-identification is performed using algorithms and software that are validated.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Supplemental Guidance:  A motivated intruder test is a test in which a person or group takes a data release and specified resources and attempts to re-identify one or more individuals in the de-identified dataset. Such tests specify the amount of inside knowledge, financial resources, computational resources, data, and skills that intruders have at their disposal to conduct the tests. A motivated intruder test can identify if de-identification is insufficient. It can also be a useful diagnostic tool to assess if de-identification is likely to be sufficient; however, the test alone cannot prove that de-identification is sufficient. </P>

<Reference xml:lang="EN-US">Table D-1</Reference>
 can be used to address the confidentiality, integrity and availability of personally identifiable information. In addition, the detailed criteria that support federal agency selection of privacy controls to manage the full life cycle processing of personally identifiable information are listed in 
<Reference xml:lang="EN-US">Appendix F</Reference>
.  
<Link>35</Link>
 for low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact systems to facilitate compliance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.
<Link>36</Link>
 The controls and control enhancements from the consolidated control catalog in 
<Link>37</Link>
 The baselines are hierarchical with respect to the controls allocated to those baselines.
<Link>38</Link>
 If a control is allocated to a baseline, the family identifier and control number are listed in the appropriate column. If a control is not allocated to a baseline, the entry is marked with a dash. Control enhancements are indicated by the enhancement number. For example, the AC-11(1) entry in the high baseline indicates that the eleventh control from the Access Control family has been selected along with control enhancement 1. Controls and control enhancements that are not allocated to any baseline can be selected on an optional basis. This can occur, for example, when the results of a risk assessment indicate the need for additional controls or control enhancements to be able to respond to the identified risks. Privacy-related controls are indicated by an "P" in the privacy-related column.

<P xml:lang="EN-US">36 Communities of interest that choose to use the security and privacy controls in this publication, may develop their own control baselines in response to the requirements from the stakeholders in the respective communities. These community-specific baselines may be driven by sector-specific requirements, and/or applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards. The tailoring guidance described in 
<Reference xml:lang="EN-US">Appendix G</Reference>
 can be effectively applied to community-specific baselines. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">37 For control selection and specification, federal organizations conduct baseline tailoring activities in accordance with OMB policy. In certain situations, OMB may prohibit federal organizations from tailoring out specific security or privacy controls. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">38 This means that the controls in the high baseline are a superset of the controls in the moderate baseline and the controls in the moderate baseline are a superset of the controls in the low baseline.

A control or control enhancement that has not been allocated to a control baseline is indicated by a blank cell. With respect to privacy controls, these control baselines can be used to address the confidentiality, integrity and availability of personally identifiable information. Criteria that support federal agency selection of privacy controls to manage the full life cycle processing of personally identifiable information are listed in

 Assurance-related controls and control enhancements are indicated by an "A" in the assurance column.

<P>
<P xml:lang="EN-US">A </P>
</P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">fter selecting an appropriate control baseline, organizations initiate a tailoring process to align the controls more closely with the specific protection needs and concerns of their stakeholders.
<Link>44</Link>
 The tailoring process is part of a comprehensive organization-wide risk management process-framing, assessing, responding to, and monitoring information security and privacy risks. Organizational tailoring decisions are not carried out in a vacuum. While such decisions are focused on security and privacy considerations, it is important that the decisions be aligned with other risk factors that organizations must routinely address. Risk factors such as cost, schedule, and performance are considered in the determination of which controls to employ in organizational systems and environments of operation.
<Link>45</Link>
 The tailoring process can include, but is not limited to, the following activities:
<Link>46</Link>
 </P>

<Footnote>
<P xml:lang="EN-US">44 It should be noted that some organizations may employ the security and privacy controls in this publication without the use of control baselines. This may occur, for example, when organizations apply the controls as part of a life cycle-based, systems engineering process during the development of systems, system components, system services. In such situations, the security and privacy controls may be selected as part of a well-defined requirements engineering process that is intended to provide a "system capability" provided through technical and non-technical means. See 
<Reference xml:lang="EN-US">Section 2.1</Reference>
.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">45 It is inappropriate to tailor out security or privacy controls that pertain to specific federal legislative, regulatory, or policy requirements. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">46 See 
<Reference xml:lang="EN-US">Appendix F</Reference>
 for additional guidance on tailoring privacy controls. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">47 Tailoring decisions can be based on timing and applicability of selected controls under certain conditions. That is, security and privacy controls may not apply in every situation or the parameter values for assignment statements may change under certain circumstances. Overlays can define these special situations, conditions, and timing/applicability- related considerations. Federal agencies conduct baseline tailoring activities in accordance with OMB policy. In certain situations, OMB may prohibit agencies from tailoring out specific security or privacy controls. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Organizations use risk management guidance to facilitate risk-based decision making regarding the applicability of the controls in the baselines. Ultimately, organizations employ the tailoring process to achieve cost-effective, risk-based solutions that support organizational missions and business needs. Organizations have the flexibility to tailor at the organization level for systems in support of a line of business or mission/business process, at the individual system level, or by using a combination of the above. However,, organizations should not arbitrarily remove security and privacy controls from baselines. Tailoring decisions should be defensible based on mission and business needs, a sound rationale, and explicit risk-based determinations.
<Link>47</Link>
 </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Tailoring decisions, including the justification for those decisions, are documented in the security and privacy plans for organizational systems. Every control from the selected control baseline is </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">accounted for by the organization. If certain controls are tailored out, the rationale is recorded in the security and privacy plans and subsequently approved by the responsible officials within the organization as part of the approval process for security and privacy plans. Documenting risk management decisions in the tailoring process is imperative for organizational officials to have the necessary information to make credible, risk-based decisions regarding security and privacy; and to do so in a manner that is transparent and facilitates accountability. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Identifying and Designating Common Controls </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Common controls are controls that may be inherited by one or more organizational systems. If a system inherits a common control, there is no need to implement the control within that system. The security or privacy function or capability is being provided by another entity. Organizational decisions on which controls are designated as common controls may affect the responsibilities of individual system owners regarding the implementation of the controls in a baseline. Common control selection can also affect the resource expenditures by organizations-that is, in general, the greater the number of common controls implemented, the greater potential cost savings as the protective measures are amortized over many systems. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Applying Scoping Considerations </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Scoping considerations, when applied in conjunction with risk management guidance, provide organizations with a more granular foundation with which to make risk-based decisions.
<Link>48</Link>
 The application of scoping considerations can eliminate unnecessary controls from the initial control baselines and ensure that organizations select only those controls that are needed to provide the appropriate level of protection. Organizations may apply the scoping considerations described below to assist with making risk-based decisions regarding control selection and specification. </P>

<Footnote>
<P xml:lang="EN-US">48 The scoping considerations listed in this section are exemplary and not intended to limit organizations in rendering risk-based decisions based on other organization-defined considerations with appropriate justification or rationale. See 
<Link xml:lang="EN-US">NIST Special Publication 800-37</Link>
 for additional information and detailed tailoring guidance on scoping considerations for control baselines required by FISMA, 
<Link xml:lang="EN-US">OMB Circular A-130</Link>
, and Federal Information Processing Standards. </P>

<LBody xml:lang="EN-US">- Control Implementation, Applicability, and Placement Considerations </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">The growing complexity of systems requires careful analysis in the implementation of security and privacy controls. Controls in the initial baselines may not be applicable to every component in the system. Controls are applicable only to system components that provide or support the security or privacy functions or capabilities addressed by the controls.
<Link>49</Link>
 Organizations make explicit risk-based decisions about where to apply or allocate specific controls in organizational systems to achieve the needed security or privacy function or capability and to satisfy security and privacy requirements. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody xml:lang="EN-US">- Operational and Environmental Considerations </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Certain controls in the control baselines assume of the existence of operational or environmental factors. Where these factors are absent or significantly diverge from the baseline assumptions, it is justifiable to tailor the baseline. Some of the more common operational/environmental factors include mobile devices and operations; single-user systems and operations; data connectivity and bandwidth; non-networked (i.e., air gapped) systems; systems that have very limited or sporadic bandwidth such as tactical systems that support warfighter or law enforcement missions; cyber-physical systems, sensors, and devices; limited functionality systems or system components such as facsimile machines, printers, scanners, smart phones, tablets, E-readers, and digital cameras; </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody xml:lang="EN-US">- Technology Considerations </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Controls that refer to specific technologies including, for example, wireless, cryptography, and public key infrastructure are applicable only if those technologies are employed or are required to be employed within organizational systems. Controls that can be more effectively supported by automated mechanisms do not require the development of such mechanisms if the mechanisms do not already exist or are not readily available in commercial or government off-the-shelf products. If automated mechanisms are not available, cost-effective, or technically feasible, compensating controls, implemented through nonautomated mechanisms or procedures, can be implemented to satisfy specified controls or control enhancements. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody xml:lang="EN-US">- Mission and Business Considerations </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Certain controls may not be appropriate if implementing those controls in a system or system component has the potential to degrade, debilitate, or otherwise hamper organizational missions or business functions including endangering or harming individuals. However, decsions on the appropriateness of implementing security or privacy controls always consider any legislative, regulatory, or policy requirements. </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_34255" xml:lang="EN-US">Selecting Compensating Controls </H3>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Compensating controls are employed by organizations in lieu of specific controls in control baselines. This occurs when controls are tailored out by necessity but the protection provided by the controls remains essential to reduce risk to an acceptable level. Compensating controls are chosen most often when implementing a baseline control is technically infeasible, not cost effective, or the implementation negatively affects organizational missions or business functions in an unacceptable manner or to an unsafe extent.
<Link>50</Link>
 For technology-based scoping considerations, compensating controls are often temporary until the system is updated. Compensating controls are intended to provide equivalent or comparable protection
<Link>51</Link>
 for systems, organizations, and individuals.
<Link>52</Link>
 Compensating controls are selected after applying the scoping considerations in the tailoring process. Compensating controls can be used under the following conditions: </P>

<Footnote>
<P xml:lang="EN-US">50 For example, additional or stronger physical security controls may be implemented in lieu of a device lock in certain real-time mission applications; in a small organization, more frequent auditing, targeted role-based training, or stronger personnel screening may be implemented in lieu of separation of duties; well-defined procedures, targeted role-based training, and more frequent auditing may be implemented in lieu of automated mechanisms.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">51 Compensating controls are not used to avoid the need to comply with requirements. Rather, the use of such controls provides alternative and suitable security and privacy protections to facilitate risk management. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">52 More than one compensating control may be required to provide the equivalent protection for a control in the catalog. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">53 Organizations should make every attempt to select compensating controls from the consolidated control catalog in 
<Reference xml:lang="EN-US">Chapter Three</Reference>
. Organization-defined compensating controls are employed only when organizations determine that the control catalog does not contain suitable compensating controls. </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_34240" xml:lang="EN-US">Assigning Control Parameter Values </H3>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Security and privacy controls and control enhancements containing embedded parameters (i.e., assignment and selection statements) give organizations the flexibility to define certain portions of controls and control enhancements to support specific organizational requirements. After the application of scoping considerations and the selection of compensating controls, organizations review the controls and control enhancements for assignment/selection statements and determine appropriate organization-defined values for the identified parameters. Parameter values may be prescribed by laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines, or industry best practices. Parameter values may also be driven by mission or business requirements. Once organizations define the parameter values for the controls and control enhancements, the assignments and selections become a permanent part of the control and control enhancement and as such, are documented in security and privacy program plans or system security and privacy plans, as appropriate. Organizations can specify the values for parameters before selecting compensating controls since the specification of the parameters completes the control definitions and may affect compensating control requirements. There can also be significant benefits in collaborating on the development of parameter values. For organizations that work together on a frequent basis, it may be useful for those organizations to develop a mutually agreeable set of uniform values for control parameters. </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_34242" xml:lang="EN-US">Supplementing Control Baselines </H3>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">The determination of what controls are needed to provide adequate security for systems and organizations and to protect the privacy of individuals is a function of an organizational risk assessment and what is required to sufficiently mitigate the security and privacy risks. In certain situations, additional controls or control enhancements beyond those controls and enhancements contained in the control baselines in 
<Reference xml:lang="EN-US">Appendix D</Reference>
 and selected based on the guidance in 
<Reference xml:lang="EN-US">Appendix F</Reference>
, will be required to address specific threats to organizations, mission/business processes, and systems; to address privacy-related issues for individuals; and to satisfy the requirements of applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Organizational assessments of risk provide essential information in determining the necessity and sufficiency of the controls and control enhancements in the control baselines. Organizations are encouraged to make maximum use of the control catalog in 
<Reference xml:lang="EN-US">Chapter Three</Reference>
 to supplement their control baselines with additional controls or control enhancements. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Providing Additional Specification Information for Control Implementation </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Since controls and control enhancements are statements of security or privacy functions or capabilities that are conveyed at higher levels of abstraction, the controls may lack sufficient information for implementation. Therefore, additional detail may be necessary to fully define the intent of a given control for implementation purposes and to ensure that the security and privacy requirements related to that control are satisfied. For example, additional information may be provided as part of the process of moving from control to specification requirement, and may involve refinement of implementation details, refinement of scope, or iteration to apply the same control differently to different scopes. This situation occurs routinely when controls are employed in a system engineering process as part of a requirements engineering. Organizations ensure that if existing control information is not sufficient to define the intended application of the control, such information is provided. Organizations have the flexibility to determine whether additional detail is included as a part of the control statement, in supplemental guidance, or in a separate </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">control addendum section. When providing additional detail, organizations are cautioned not to change the intent of the control or modify the original language in the control. The additional implementation information can be documented in security and privacy plans. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Creating Overlays </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">The previous sections described tailoring control baselines to achieve needed security or privacy functions or capabilities. In certain situations, it may be beneficial for organizations to apply the tailoring guidance to the control baselines to develop a set of controls for particular communities of interest or to address specialized requirements, technologies, or unique missions/environments of operation. An organization may decide to establish a set of controls for specific applications or use cases, for example, cloud-based systems that could be uniformly applied to organizations procuring or implementing such services; industrial control systems generating and transmitting electric power or controlling environmental systems in facilities; systems processing, storing, or transmitting classified information; or systems controlling the safety of transportation systems. In each of the above examples, overlays can be developed for each sector or technology area or for unique circumstances or environments and promulgated to large communities of interest-thus achieving standardized security and privacy capabilities, consistency of implementation, and cost-effective security and privacy solutions. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">To address the need for specialized sets of controls for communities of interest, systems, and organizations, the concept of overlay is introduced. An overlay is a fully specified set of controls, control enhancements, and supplemental guidance derived from the application of tailoring guidance to control baselines.
<Link>54</Link>
 Overlays complement the initial control baselines by providing the opportunity to add or eliminate controls; providing control applicability and interpretations for specific technologies, computing paradigms, environments of operation, types of systems, types of missions/operations, operating modes, industry sectors, and statutory/regulatory requirements; establishing parameter values for assignment and/or selection statements in controls and control enhancements agreeable to communities of interest; and extending the supplemental guidance for controls, where necessary. Organizations use the overlay concept when there is divergence from the basic assumptions used to create the initial control baselines. In many ways, overlays function like alternative control baselines and may require tailoring like the baselines in Appendix D. That is, using an overlay is not a substitute for the full tailoring process. </P>

<Footnote>
<P xml:lang="EN-US">54 Control baselines can include the federally-mandated baselines in 
<Reference xml:lang="EN-US">Appendix D</Reference>
; baselines developed by State, local, or tribal governments; or baselines developed by private sector organizations including, for example, manufacturers, consortia, trade associations, industry and critical infrastructure sectors. </P>
</Footnote>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">The full range of tailoring activities can be employed by organizations to provide a disciplined and structured approach for developing tailored control baselines supporting the areas described above. Overlays provide an opportunity to build consensus across communities of interest and develop security and privacy plans for systems and organizations that have broad-based support for very specific circumstances, situations, and/or conditions. Categories of overlays that may be useful include, for example: </P>

NIST Special Publication 800-39 includes guidance on managing risk at the organizational level, mission/business process level, and information system level, is consistent with ISO/IEC 27001. ISO/IEC 15408 (Common Criteria) provides functionality and assurance requirements for developers of systems and system components (i.e., information technology products). Since many of the technical security controls defined in 
<Reference xml:lang="EN-US">Chapter Three</Reference>
 are implemented in hardware, software, and firmware components of systems, organizations can obtain significant benefit from the acquisition and employment of components and systems evaluated against the requirements of ISO/IEC 15408. The use of evaluated systems and components can provide evidence that certain security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired effect with respect to satisfying stated security requirements.

<P xml:lang="EN-US">To successfully meet the mapping criteria (i.e., a control appearing in one of the mapping tables), the implementation of the mapped controls should result in an equivalent information security function or capability. However, this does not mean that security control equivalency based solely on the mapping tables herein should be assumed by organizations. While the control mappings are accurate as possible, there is still some degree of subjectivity in the mapping analysis because the mappings are not always one-to-one and may not be completely equivalent. To help clarify the control mappings, when a control in the right column of Tables I-1 and I-2 does not fully satisfy the intent of the control in the left column of the tables, the control in the right column is designated with an asterisk (*).  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Occasionally, an ISO/IEC 27001 control could only be directly mapped to a NIST Special Publication 800-53 control enhancement. In such cases, the relevant enhancement is specified in Table I-2 indicating that the corresponding ISO/IEC 27001 control meets the intent of the NIST Special Publication 800-53 control enhancement only and does not address the associated base control or any other enhancements under that base control. Where no enhancement is specified, the ISO/IEC 27001 control is relevant only to the NIST Special Publication 800-53 base control. Finally, the controls from ISO/IEC 27002 were not considered in the mapping analysis since the standard is informative rather than normative. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Organizations may leverage the control mappings provided in Tables I-1 and I-2 when dealing with external entities, including, for example, in defining security and privacy requirements in contracts and agreements. Organizations are responsible for analyzing the ISO/IEC controls and </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">requirements for consistency with the controls in Special Publication 800-53 and resolving any gaps in coverage and protection. Additionally, because of the control selection process, controls beyond those implemented as part of the ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 15408 standards may be selected, implemented, and assessed to ensure protection of information commensurate with risk. Ultimately, the decision to leverage ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 15408 assessments remains with the organization's authorizing official. In leveraging such assessments, authorizing officials determine if the work performed in accordance with the ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 15408 standards, is acceptable. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-US">Table I-3 provides a generalized mapping from the functional and assurance requirements in ISO/IEC 15408 (Common Criteria) to the controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53. The table represents an informal correspondence between requirements and controls (i.e., the table is not intended to determine whether the ISO/IEC 15408 requirements are fully satisfied, partially satisfied, or not satisfied by the associated controls. However, the table can serve as a beneficial starting point for further correspondence analysis. Organizations are cautioned that satisfying ISO/IEC 15408 requirements for an evaluated and validated information technology product as represented by the presence of certain controls from 
<Reference xml:lang="EN-US">Chapter Three</Reference>
, does not imply that such requirements have been satisfied throughout the entire system (which may consist of multiple, integrated individual component products). Additional information explaining the specific mappings that appear in Table I-3 is available at the
